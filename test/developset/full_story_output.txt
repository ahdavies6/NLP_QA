A Montreal biotechnology firm has successfully cloned triplet goats. The
kids are named Clint, Arnold and Danny.

This first Canadian cloning could lead to breakthroughs in the treatment
of injuries like broken limbs and torn human tissues.

The company used the same technology invented by Scottish scientists to
clone Dolly the sheep in 1997.

Cloning is the first step in a process that could ultimately lead to the
mass production of a material known as BioSteel. Biosteel is an
artificial spider silk developed by Nexia Biotechnologies.

Company president Jeffrey Turner says the silk can be used in tissue
repair, neurosurgery and sutures, and to create artificial tendons and
ligaments, among other uses. Nexia aims to extract the spider silk from
goat's milk.

While nobody has yet made a fabric from biosteel, Mr. Turner is
convinced the protein can be turned into a supermaterial because of its
natural role in the silk of a spider's web.

"When you think of what a web has to do, its extreme strength makes
perfect sense," he says. The silken threads of the web must be nearly 
invisible to prey and yet be able to bring a fly to a screeching halt.

Clint, Arnold and Danny were born in March.

To clone the triplet goats, a nucleus with a mass of cells from a source
goat was placed in a petri dish and cultured.

One of these cells was then implanted into a mature, unfertilized egg.
This replaced the egg's original DNA, which had been removed. This
process was done three times, each time using the same source cells.

The eggs were then placed into two recipient mothers, with one female
carrying two eggs, and the other the third.

Because cells were taken from the same source, the three kids have
exactly the same genetic makeup.

The potential to mass-produce BioSteel is a main reason the animals were
cloned in the first place.

Mr. Turner says that BioSteel is the strongest substance known to man,
with a tensile strength of 300,000 pounds per square inch. BioSteel is
an artificial spider silk that is environmentally friendly, extremely
strong and light, and compatible with the human body, says Mr. Turner.

The company hopes eventually to extract this spider silk from goat's
milk. Turner said the company will soon clone a sheep with the
spider-silk gene in its genetic makeup.

In the past year, the company tried injecting a spider-silk gene
directly into the goat. But that system wasn't efficient enough. It
worked on only four goats in a hundred.

The new method could have close to a 100-per-cent success rate.

Next year the company will clone another goat that will carry the
spider-silk gene in its chromosomes. The silk protein can be extracted
from the goat when it starts to produce milk.

Turner said Nexia will clone only about three or four goats with the
spider-silk protein. They can then reproduce with normal goats, and
their offspring will still have the spider-silk gene in their bodies.

But Clint, Arnold and Danny aren't making everyone happy. Some
animal-rights activists and ethicists oppose the concept of cloning
living beings.

Professor Margaret Somerville says she does not agree with cloning for
the purposes of creating a superior race of animals -- such as faster
race horses or stronger elephants. However, she sees an argument in
cloning animals "for valid, justified purposes."

The debate around cloning animals, food products and even human beings
is growing all across the world.

It means that lawmakers are having to sit down to decide what should be
allowed, and what should be made illegal.
Albertans are rich in wealth but poor in spirit, says the author of a
recent study.

Armine Yalnizyan, an economist who studied the differences between
Canada's rich and poor,  found that the difference between rich and poor
was growing fastest in Alberta. Yalnizyan also noted that Albertans are
extremely competitive, and have a " law of the jungle" view of life.

 It's this outlook of, `If you can get it, keep it. And if you're not
getting it, then you're a loser,''' Ms. Yalnizyan said Thursday during a
speech. Yalnizyan added that she did not hear that type of thinking in
too many places in Canada.

Yalnizyan's report is for the Centre For Social Justice in Toronto. It
uses Statistics Canada figures to look at growing income differences
between Canada's rich and poor.

When Yalnizyan looked at the Alberta data, she discovered that while
Alberta's economy is growing, the difference between the rich and poor
is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else in Canada.

The difference is most noticeable in Calgary where the city's prosperity
has meant more high-paying management jobs, but also more unstable and
low-paying part-time work.

Yalnizyan feels that attitudes are as much to blame for this inequality
as government spending cuts, a low minimum wage and the spread of
part-time jobs. She argues that cultural expectations are one of the
first factors shaping the way the labour market performs.

One example, she said, is Albertans' enthusiasm for tax cuts even though
the province's health care and education systems are in bad shape, and
need tax money to be improved.

"There's a kind of sky's-the-limit attitude. What's mine is mine. And
the more disparate incomes get, the more accentuated these attitudes
get, and more of a lottery mentality occurs."
This week the National Post newspaper published an obituary of Geoffrey
Dewis, a man who died in Vancouver at the age of 69. Mr. Dewis was not a
famous person himself, but he was part of a remarkable event in Canadian
history. 

In 1939, the Second World War began in Europe and England. Geoffrey
Dewis was then nine.  His parents feared that Geoffrey and his older
sister would be killed in the Nazi bombing of England. But there was a
way to keep the kids safe. They took advantage of the Commonwealth child
evacuation program.  Over 2,600 British children were sent to live with
families in other Commonwealth countries where the war was not raging.
Over half of those children -- 1530 of them -- came to live in Canada as
guests. Some, like Geoffrey Dewis, returned to Canada to spend the rest
of their lives.

During the war, the trip to Canada was not easy.  German submarines
lurked in the North Atlantic sea where the boats traveled. They fired
torpedoes at British and Allied ships. Geoffrey Dewis's ship was the
last to arrive safely at its destination.  The next boatload of British
kids, on a ship called The City of Benares, was torpedoed and sank.
Seventy-seven children on board died. Tragically, that was the end of
the "guest child" program.

During their stay in Canada, CBC Radio produced a program called "Canada
Calling" so that the British kids who were separated from their families
could speak to their parents and friends back home over the airwaves.
The Newfoundland government has a new weapon in its fight to increase
the seal hunt: film of cod carnage.

Underwater footage shows "tens of thousands of cod lying on the bottom,
gutted. It looks pretty bad," says Mary MacNab, the government's
seal industry promotions officer.

"From my own impression, it's the killing fields."

The footage, filmed last week by fishermen using government
supplied equipment, shows the ocean floor after a group of seals
crowded cod into a bay and started feasting.

Lloyd Oldford of Red Cliff, Bonavista Bay, a fisherman who first alerted
Efford to the problem, said the video in no way shows the true extent of
the destruction fishermen are seeing.

"I can show you 100 miles of it," said Oldford. "There's nothing but
dead fish in every crook and cranny. It's everywhere, massive
destruction.

It's taking away a great source of income from us. If we don't do
something about this seal problem, more people are going to be leaving
the province."

John Efford, Newfoundland's fisheries minister, says the "very
disturbing" images will wake up people to the toll seals are taking
on northern cod stocks.

There has been a moratorium - a temporary ban -  on fishing for cod
since 1992 after fish stocks dropped to dangerous levels.

"We thought by bringing in the moratorium, that in a few years
the cod stocks would start to return," he says.

"But seven years after the closure of the ground fish industry,
stocks today are worse then they were previous to 1992.

"There's only one answer to that.... We've got an
overpopulated seal herd."

Mr. Efford says the seal herd, which is estimated at six million, needs
to be cut in half. That would mean increasing the annual quota of
275,000 harp seals to between 475,000 and 575,000 animals.

Jeff Hutchings, a professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova
Scotia says it is a stretch for Mr. Efford to use evidence of seals
preying on cod in one location to argue for a massive cull (harvest) of
the seal herd.

"The degree to which seals are retarding the recovery of cod
stocks remains an open question. Maybe they are. Maybe they
aren't."

He adds that documentation of seals having eaten only
the fish stomachs suggests scientists may have underestimated how
many cod the seals kill.

Researchers detect traces of fish in seal stomachs only if they
eat the whole fish.

Today, sealing comprises a vital part of Newfoundland's sluggish
economy. In 1996 alone it was worth in excess of $11 million, with seal
products being sold in Canada, Norway and Asia.
Light rain and cooler temperatures are giving crews a hand in battling
several large forest fires across Northern Ontario.

However, it may be well into next week before some people will be
allowed to return home.

In the northwest, hundreds of residents from three communities have been
forced to leave their homes.

A state of emergency has also been declared in Chapleau, where
residents are on standby in preparation for an evacuation order.

More than 700 people have already left. Yesterday, the fire was only 9
kilometres from the town. The area had a little rain overnight -- it's not known what effect that has had on the fire.

Just across the border in Manitoba, some rain did fall and dampened the
forest fire threat. It means the province could send fire fighters and
equipment to the latest hot spot in northwestern Ontario.

"We are trying to assist our neighbours to the east," said Natural
Resources spokesman Bob Buck.

Rain fell on most of the trouble spots in Manitoba during the middle of
the week with the exception of the 120-hectare blaze at Island Lake, 500
kilometres northeast of Winnipeg.

"St. Theresa Point is the only area that did not receive precipitation,"
said Natural Resources Minister Glen Cummings.

He said investigators are looking at the possibility that the fire was
deliberately set. It has already destroyed some houses in the tiny
community and 57 residents were airlifted to Winnipeg, where they still
await word that they can go home.

But another 600 or more evacuated from the Manigotagan area on the
eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg could return to their homes soon, now
that rain has helped crews get the fire in that area under control.

There were 61 fires burning in Manitoba Wednesday out of 171 so far this
year. About 33,500 hectares of timber have been consumed.

There is now a ban on all open fires for most of Northwestern Ontario.

"Our forest conditions right now are volatile," said Bob Thomas,
information officer for the provincial response centre. "It virtually
takes a spark to get it going."

Since April 1, almost all of the province's 200 fires were triggered by
human causes.
Usually, a when doctors are being trained to perform operations, they
learn by practising on real, live human patients -- something patients
are not always happy about. Now, doctors learning surgery at a Toronto
hospital are being trying a new method of learning.

The surgical skills centre at Mt. Sinai hospital is a sort of training
camp for residents (new doctors). There are only a few such centres in
the world.

Students practise stitches and cutting on latex intestines, rather than
live patients. The latex looks and feels like the real thing. For
students like Dr. Deepa Kumar, they're an even better teaching tool.

"It's a great advantage because you can stop and talk and take things
out and start again." Residents learn skills ranging from basic surgery
to reviving a patient who isn't breathing.

"The feedback I have received here has helped me to go home and perfect
my technique," says Dr. Douglas Grace. "I think that it has made me a
much better surgical resident."

Dr. Richard Reznick is one of the instructors at the centre. "I think
that it's probably fair to say that we're one of the leaders in
technical skill training," he said, "in terms of understanding how it's
accessed and how it's taught."

Soon residents might be learning through 3-D animation programs and
virtual patients. For now, residents might have to settle for the latex
simulations.
A month after fleeing battered and bloodied Kosovo, Yugoslavia with
nothing but the clothes on their backs, Qemal Sefa and his family
arrived at their new home in Winnipeg, Manitoba last night.

Looking tired and anxious after days of travel, Sefa, his wife and four
grown children greeted members of their extended family - many of whom
they had never met - at the airport with shy smiles, hugs and kisses.

Speaking through an interpreter, Sefa said he was happy to finally be in
Winnipeg and offered his thanks to the Canadian people for opening their
doors to him and his family.

The six ethnic Albanian refugees - the first to make their way to 
Western Canada - will be staying with Sefa's brother Esat and his son
Haki.

"This last month has been rough," Sefa said. "We were not happy to leave
our home, but we are glad to be here and safe."

A month ago, Sefa, 59, and his family were given less than five minutes
to leave their home in the town of Gjakov by Serb forces who ordered
them out of Kosovo.

The family took no clothes, mementos or household items with them and
walked about seven kilometres to the Albanian border.

While most of Sefa's family made the trip to the Albanian capital of
Tirana safely, his youngest son, Orland, 23, never showed up.

"We don't know if he's alive or dead," Sefa said.

Esat Sefa said he has been wanting to bring his family to Canada ever
since fighting erupted in Kosovo.

He said he often tried to send money and supplies to them but shipments
were regularly intercepted by Serb forces who kept the money and goods
for themselves.

Sefa and his family will receive support from the federal government for
up to two years, during which time they can apply to stay in Canada
permanently.

But Sefa - who recently retired from his job at a theatre after 45 years
- said last night it may not take that long for him to decide where to
make his new home.

"Maybe we stay here," he said as his wife gestured with a nod.

Another 10 Albanian refugees will head north to Thompson, Manitoba today
to be reunited with family members there.

Ninety more refugees with relatives in Manitoba are expected to make
their way to the province over the next month. At least 700 more ethnic
Albanian refugees are expected in the coming weeks.

Hundreds of thousands of refugees are now living in camps just outside
of Yugoslavia. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees says
those camps are almost full. Aid workers are doing their best to
shepherd the refugees to camps that have space.

Canada originally planned to take in 5,000 refugees and house them at
Canadian Forces bases. But the UN decided it would be better to keep
refugees closer to home to ease their return when the war ends.

NEWS FLASH

The federal government has reopened its plan to airlift 5,000 Kosovo
Albanians to refuge in Canada.

Canada put the airlift on hold three weeks ago when the UN decided it
was better to keep ethnic Albanians driven from Kosovo by Serbian forces
close to home.

At that time, the UN figured it would be easier to resettle them when a
peace deal is reached with Yugoslavia.

Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard says she was asked today to
"reactivate" the plan by the United Nations agency responsible for
refugees.

And Ms. Robillard responded that Canada will do so.

The minister says the refugees will begin arriving Monday. Ms. Robillard
says 300 people a day will be airlifted to Canada for about two weeks.
On Oscar night -- Sunday, March 21 -- actors Tom Hanks, and Gwyneth
Paltrow and director Steven Spielberg  won't be the only ones sitting on
the edge of their seats, hoping to hear their name read out. Canadian
Wang Shui-Bo will also be in the audience hoping to win.

Wang Shui-Bo is nominated for an Oscar for Best Short Documentary for
his half-hour film "Sunrise over Tiananmen Square."

The film is a Wang's perspective on the events that led up to June 4,
1989, when Chinese government troops opened fire on student
demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

Wang traces his personal journey through a collage of original
artwork mixed with family and archival photographs.  It's a journey
that begins with Wang as a loyal Communist, full of the political
idealism common in China under the early years of leader Mao Tse Tung.
It ends with him as an anti-government activist
willing to risk his life to uphold the
first stirrings of democracy.

"Sunrise over Tiananmen Square" shows how the dream starts to fade
during the Cultural Revolution in the '60s and '70s, when the Red Guards
attack and destroy anything linked to the old Chinese culture. And how
the dream is crushed when the tanks roll in Tiananmen Square.

Wang fled China after the student uprising and now lives in
Montreal, Quebec.  But he was in Beijing when he learned of his
Oscar nomination.

Even today his film can't be shown in China. But Wang
hopes that one day that will change, and explosive subjects
such as the Tiananmen Square massacre will no longer be
taboo.

Wang believes his film delivers a message that the tragedy
at Tiananmen should never happen again. "China doesn't
need a revolution. The people here don't need another
revolution. We have suffered so much since 100 years ago."
"It's time to enjoy life," Wang says.

Wang may now live in the West, but he'll wear a traditional
Chinese jacket for the Oscars and if he wins, Wang knows
exactly what he'll say: "Thank you to my motherland, China.
Thank you Canada, thank you Montreal, merci Quebec."
When native Canadians tell you their family has been living here for a
long time, you'd better believe them, say a growing number of
archeologists.

Try 40,000 years, to be precise.

New research suggests that's how long people have inhabited the Yukon.

That is tens of thousands of years earlier than originally thought.

The previously accepted theory about the populating of North America was
that the first
inhabitants crossed a land bridge from Asia into what is now Alaska
roughly 10,000 to 11,000
years ago, after the last Ice Age.

Since the 1960s, scientists have pointed to "Clovis points" - 10,000 to
11,000-year-old stone tools found throughout
much of unglaciated North America.

But recently, scientists have suggested that the region known as Eastern
Beringia, now in the
eastern Yukon, could have been inhabited at least as far back as 25,000
years ago.

Some researchers think habitation of the Americas dates back even
further.

"My view is that there is no question that there were people in Eastern
Beringia 40,000 years ago, and this view has to be taken into serious
consideration if you want to discuss the peopling of the New World,"
says Jacques Cinq-Mars, an archeologist at the Canadian Museum of
Civilization in Ottawa.

At that time, during an ice age, much of North America sat under a
kilometre-thick slab of glacial ice. But the Beringia area,
which stretched from Siberia across Alaska and Yukon and into the
Northwest Territories, remained ice-free.

The latest evidence supporting the earlier dates was found in the
Bluefish Caves, on the Bluefish River about 50 kilometres southeast of
Old Crow. Archeologists found in the caves a mammoth bone that was
probably flaked and shaped by human hands roughly 23,500 years ago.

The caves also contained hundreds of bones from at least 18 species of
migratory birds. The bones are anywhere from 10,000 to 25,000 years old.
Many of the bird bones also show human-made cut marks.

Mr. Cinq-Mars believes the caves were likely used by hunters over a
period of roughly 15,000
years. The Bluefish Caves were re-discovered by Mr. Cinq-Mars in 1975.
He led a research team that excavated the caves 1978 and 1987.
The team's findings are showcased at the Beringia Interpretive Centre on
the Alaska Highway.

Heather Pringle is the author of In Search of Ancient North America,
part of which is about the
Bluefish Caves in northern Yukon.

She says that "most people still think of archeologists as wild guys in
jungles looking for priceless artifacts to go in a museum. It seems to
me archeology is much more about uncovering the lives of ancient
people."
The president of the Quebec Federation of Nurses says she will not obey back-to-work legislation that Premier Lucien Bouchard is expected to introduce later today.

Premier Bouchard has called an emergency meeting of the Quebec National
Assembly. He plans to introduce special legislation to force the
province's 47,000 striking nurses back to work.

The legislation could impose jail sentences on the leaders of the
nurses' union if they do not call off the strike immediately.

Quebec Federation of Nurses Vice-President Michele Boisclair has said
that the Executive of the Federation is prepared to go to jail if that's
what it takes.

Ms. Boisclair told the Montreal Gazette, "When you see nurses are
willing to go that far, it shows how bad it is in the healthcare
system."

Nurses are now demonstrating on the sidewalks outside all Quebec
hospitals. Public opinion seems to be on their side. Many drivers are
honking their horns to show their support. In restaurants and on the
street conversations are about the strike and how nurses deserve to be
paid more money.

Quebec nurses make between $32,000 and $44,000 a year. They are the
lowest-paid nurses in Canada.

Premier Bouchard is reluctant to give the nurses' more money because
they are only the first of many labour organizations negotiating new
contracts. If Bouchard agrees to give the nurses a raise, he will also
have to give the other health care groups more money.

Quebec ambulance technicians have also threatened to strike, and earlier
this week, more than 90 per cent of hospital pharmacists submitted their
resignations. The pharmacists will leave their jobs in 60 days if the
situation does not improve.

Some of Quebec's doctors are also taking a stand. Some doctors have said
they will resign unless the Premier comes up with more money for health
care.

Today is the seventh day of the nurses strike.
Workers at a McDonald's restaurant in Montreal, Quebec have voted
against becoming members of a trade union.
There is only one unionized McDonald's restaurant in North America. It
is in Squamish, British Columbia.

About 90 per cent of the outlet's 55 workers voted against unionizing.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters had been trying to organize
the workers for 16 months.

Rejean Lavigne, head of the Teamsters local behind the campaign,
said almost all of the original employees who signed union cards in
1997 had quit and the new ones, some as young as 16, didn't want a
union.

"If we lose, well, we can't do anything more," Lavigne said
before the vote was tallied. "If the employees don't want us there, what
are you going to
do?"

A statement from McDonald's Quebec regional office welcomed the vote.

"We believe that giving all the employees in the outlet the opportunity
to determine the outcome of this matter was the fairest and most
responsible way to resolve the question of union representation," the
statement said.

The McDonald's in Squamish became the first unionized outlet
among the chain's more than 15,000 outlets in North America when the
Canadian Auto Workers made a breakthrough last August.

Rejection of the union in Montreal was the second failure for the
Teamsters against the chain. Last year, a franchise in suburban
St-Hubert, Quebec shut down just as the union was about to be certified.

The latest loss means an end to a campaign begun last year to
unionize at least one McDonald's in every major city across Canada,
which has so far cost the Teamsters about $100,000.

Union officials in Quebec say lengthy delays used by employers to fight
certification played into McDonald's hands by discouraging its young
employees.

"We received petitions saying thank you for the good work but we don't
need you any more," Lavigne said. "The workers fired us in effect."
The Quebec politician known as the father of Bill 101 -- the province's
very controversial language law -- has died.

Camille Laurin was 76. He had been ill with cancer.

Dr. Laurin was a psychiatrist who became active in Quebec politics
during the 1960's.

He was first elected to the Quebec National Assembly, Quebec's
legislative assembly,  in 1970.

Dr. Camille Laurin once described his beloved language law as the
"re-conquest" of Quebec. He was referring to the history of Quebec.
During the 18th and 19th century, French-speaking Quebecers were often
ruled by governments that were controlled by England. Many
French-speaking Quebecers considered themselves to
have been conquered by "les anglais" - the English.

By the 1950's French-speaking Quebecers were increasingly convinced that
the only way to stand up for their own rights was for Quebec to become
an independent country, separate from Canada. Camille Laurin was among
them.   

Bill 101 required signs in Quebec to be in French. Before Bill 101
became law many signs in Quebec were only in English, even though the
majority of the population is French speaking. Bill 101 also required
the children of immigrants to go to French schools. Many French-speaking
Quebecers were worried that immigrants would choose English schools for
their children. That would mean that the French language would slowly
die away.

Many English-speaking Quebecers did not like Bill 101 because they felt
it took away their freedom to put up English signs. They also disagreed
with the government telling immigrants which schools they must
attend.    

Bill 101 came into effect in 1977. For many years it was big news in
Quebec as there were many demonstrations - both from people who
supported the bill and from those who hated it.

One thing was never in question, however, was Dr. Laurin's passionate
love of Quebec.

"Dr. Laurin was a pioneer, a builder, a man of conviction, determined,"
says Francois Gendron, chairman of the Parti Quebecois caucus in the
legislature.

Liberal opposition Leader Jean Charest praised his protection of the
French language.

"He was a man who was devoted to the interests of Quebec  and in that
sense today is a day of sadness for us."

To some in the English-language community, Laurin symbolized
francophones who wanted to crush the anglophone minority.

William Johnson, a hardline English-rights activist, said he
was personally saddened by the death of his ideological opponent.

"He was very cultivated man, with a seductive charm."

But the president of the Alliance Quebec English-rights lobby
condemned Laurin's masterwork as an attempt to "wipe out
bilingualism" in Canada.

Bill 101 is credited by Quebec
nationalists as helping preserve the French language in a sea of
English in North America.

Dr. Laurin made no apologies for the law's toughness, saying the law
simply reflected Quebec's demographic reality.

Although it meant a lower profile for anglophones and less clout
after years of predominance, Laurin said it took away no basic
rights and recognized their institutions, schools and media.
A judge in Saskatchewan has ruled that a 13-year-old boy cannot make his own decisions about treatment for the cancer that is destroying his bones.

Doctors say that Tyrell Dueck, 13, will die from cancer in less than a year if he doesn t have part of his thigh bone removed and undergo chemotherapy treatments. But the boy refuses to continue the treatment.

Today, Judge A. R. Rothery ruled that Tyrell is influenced by his father, and cannot make an independent decision. The judge said the boy is misinformed, and that social services must now step in to help him.

Experts testified in court in Saskatoon yesterday that Tyrell is capable of making a decision, but that his decision is based on misinformation from his father. Tyrell s father wants him to undergo alternative therapy at a clinic in Tijuana, Mexico. The treatment consists of herbal remedies, doses of vitamins and a special diet.

Psychologist Jo Nanson said Tyrell believes the tumour on his thigh bone is not cancerous because his father told him so. He also believes that herbal and vitamin treatments at the Tijuana clinic will make him well again.

Nanson said Tyrell s only source of information is his father, who won t permit his son to speak alone with a medical doctor. Nanson also said that Tyrell wouldn t think of disobeying his father.

A psychiatrist who talked to Tyrell to find out what he knew about his condition told the court that the boy hasn t received enough medical information.

In the end, lawyers on both sides agree Tyrell should have a chance to speak with his cancer doctor alone. That s something his parents have yet to allow.
Television is behind a growing controversy in a Mississauga, Ontario
high school. And it's got nothing to do with what students are watching
in their spare time at home.

It's about teens having to watch commercials in school. 
Every day. It's a controversy about the growing commercialization of
schools.

Youth News Network, a private news and current-affairs network, has
installed a satellite dish and thousands of dollars worth of televisions
and audio-visual equipment at Meadowvale Secondary School free of
charge. It expects to start broadcasting its 12-minute newscast --
complete with 2 1/2 minutes of commercials -- every day to the school's
1,700 students starting in September.

But along with the bonanza of technology, the school is
inheriting a political hot potato.

"I happen to believe that it is completely unacceptable to sell off
little
bits of our kids," said Heather-Jane Robertson, director of professional
development with the Canadian Teachers Federation. "If we don't
understand
that it's wrong to sell off our kids to advertisers, to compromise
public
education in that way, then we can hardly turn around and blame the
people
who want to make money off our stupidity."

Some educators say YNN serves as an example of the wave of
commercialization sweeping over schools at a time when funding cuts are
forcing public boards to look to businesses for help.

While public broadcasters such as CBC Newsworld and TV Ontario provide
programming free of charge to schools, none can come close to providing
the
wealth of televisions, VCRs, computers, and video cameras installed at
Meadowvale under its pilot project with YNN's owner, Montreal-based
Athena
Educational Partners Inc.

Meadowvale principal Laurie Pedwell conceded that the technology was
part
of YNN's appeal. But she insisted that the sample broadcast viewed by
students last
November was balanced and suitably tailored to teenagers.

As for the advertisements, she said none was offensive or aggressively
pushing a product, and most depicted teenagers positively.

The school has a June deadline to decide whether it wants to sign a
five-year contract with YNN.

Stephanie Lake is a grade twelve student at Meadowvale secondary. She
recently wrote this essay about YNN coming to her school.
 
"We may be teenagers, but we're not all couch potatoes!  Well, at
least we weren't.

Who knows, maybe one day soon, secondary school students all across
Canada will be the same - walking, brainwashed zombies.  The blame
for this can be placed squarely on the shoulders of YNN and the
governors of our education system.

Trust the government. I don't think so!

I am upset with the administration of my school for using us, the
students, as guinea pigs, in a test which uses televisions
inappropriately in my school.

Canadian female music stars were among the big winners at last night's
Grammy Awards show in Los Angeles, California.

Celine Dion, Shania Twain, and Alanis Morissette picked up two grammys
apiece.

Among the awards, Ms. Dion won record of the year for "My Heart Will Go
On." But American hip-hop artist Lauryn Hill, beat them all. She took
home five Grammys, including album of the year.

Ms. Hill broke Carole King's 1971 record for most awards won by a female
artist in a single night.

"This is crazy because this is hip-hop music," Ms. Hill said in
accepting the first best-album Grammy for a hip-hop artist as the
usually conservative awards show took its biggest step out of the
mainstream.

Rap has been eclipsing rock as the dominant musical form for young
people, and routinely produces best sellers. Much of the credit goes to
Ms. Hill, a 23-year-old mother of two whose music mixes rap and R and
touches on family and political issues. She had won two earlier Grammys
with the Fugees.

Shania Twain, Stevie Wonder, the Dixie Chicks and the Brian Setzer
Orchestra each were double winners Wednesday night.

Sheryl Crow won for best rock album, and Madonna also picked up her
first musical Grammy, including best pop album for her excursion into
electronica, "Ray of Light". She also won best dance recording and best
short form music video.

"I've been in the music business 16 years. It was worth the wait,"
Madonna said backstage.

After 51 years of performing, Patti Page won her first Grammy,
for traditional pop vocal performance for "Live at Carnegie Hall --
The 50th Anniversary Concert". She joked backstage that family
members once asked what her grandchildren should call her.

"Grammy. Because I'll never get one," she recalled telling
them. "Now they can call me grandma."

"Titanic" sailed on as the ballad "My Heart Will Go On" won
four Grammys, including best female pop vocal for Celine Dion and
best song written for a motion picture or television. James Horner
and Will Jennings picked up the writing trophies.
The movie's soundtrack was the top-selling
album of 1998, with more than 9 million units sold.

Mr. Horner told the Shrine Auditorium and national television
audiences he initially considered the song just a movie theme.

"It spoke to a lot of people," Horner said backstage. "It
obviously was very romantic in a wistful, timeless way." He
admitted he no longer listens to the song.

Actor-rapper Will Smith won best rap song for his good-natured
"Gettin' Jiggy Wit It." He paid tribute to God, "the jiggiest
wife in the world" (actress Jada Pinkett Smith) and his son, about
whom he received bad news in his first parent-teacher conference
Wednesday.

"His rhyming skills are down," Smith said. "I swear -- that's
what the teacher told me."

Jay-Z's "Vol. 2 ... Hard Knock Life" won best rap album,
though he skipped the show because he doesn't like the way the
Grammys treat rap. The Beastie Boys won duo or group performance
for "Intergalactic."

Canadian music historian Colin Escott won in the category of best
historical album with is compliation of "The Complete Hank Williams." 

American talk show host Rosie O'Donnell served as master of ceremonies.
A second planeload of refugees from Kosovo landed in Canada early this
morning. The 264 people are among the first of the 5,000 people of
Albanian heritage from the southern Yugoslavian province of Kosovo who
will be coming to Canada. The refugees have been living in tents in the
Stenkovac refugee camp in Macedonia since they left Yugoslavia.

The plane touched down at Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Greenwood, Nova
Scotia, at 1 a.m. local time, 10 hours behind schedule.

The tired Albanians put on smiles for Red Cross volunteers and military
officials. They told waiting reporters they were grateful for the safety
Canada provides, but it was clear many will spend their time in Canada
dreaming of returning home.

On hand to greet his countrymen was Burnaby, British Columbia resident
Shamsay Amoosa. Mr. Amoosa fled his homeland six years ago - from a civil
war that few outside the country then paid attention to.

"Canada is a good country," Amoosa told the refugees. "You will be safe
here until things are better at home and then we will help you go back if you want."

Ahmet Konyoury, who was on the plane with his wife and youngest
daughter, said he didn't want to leave Kosovo. Rather, he had no choice.
"People over there, like Serbian military, said 'You like NATO, go
there,' 'You like Clinton, go there,'" he told CBC News through a
translator.

The Konyourys were one of the lucky ones who made it to Canada. At the
filthy and overcrowded camps on Wednesday, thousands of refugees waited
anxiously to hear their names called for overbooked flights to Canada.

Officials had overbooked the plane after some families changed their
mind at the last minute and didn't show up for the first flight.

But on Wednesday, almost all the families lined up for the flight --
plus some. That meant delays as officials tried to sort out who would go
and who must stay. 
 
Like the Konyourys -- and the refugees who wait still -- each person,
each family, has a story about their plight, and their hopes for the
future.

The United Nations says the Kosovo refugee crisis could grow by another
half million. Here are the numbers so far: 17,000 refugees in Bosnia,
62,000 in Montenegro, 404,000 in Albania, and 211,000 in Macedonia.

There seems to be some movement towards putting an end to the war in
Yugoslavia.

The world's major powers may be close to a diplomatic breakthrough to
end the conflict. The Group of Eight nations, including Russia, the
United States, and Canada, have agreed to a seven-point plan to find
peace in Kosovo, including the basic terms of an international force to
secure the return of refugees.

The plan must now be approved by the United Nations Security Council,
which represents 185 countries from all over the world.

The Yugoslavian government has not yet reacted to the plan.
Chemicals are polluting the animals of the Arctic, a United Nations
conference was told this week. The build-up of these chemicals makes
eating Arctic fish and game a frightening and tricky business.

The issue came to a head recently as both Canadian aboriginal and
federal delegates attended a United Nations conference in Africa. They
were seeking to bring attention to the negative effects of
globally-produced chemical contaminants on the Arctic food chain.

Carole Mills works with the problem daily, both in the contaminants
division of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, and as a
representative of the Canadian Arctic Indigenous Peoples Against POPs.
"POPS" are persistent organic pollutants.

"The contamination of animals is confusing and sometimes even alarming,
and even my own family members have sometimes stopped eating fish
until I could talk to them and explain that the contaminants do
concentrate in specific parts, so you don't have to stop eating the
animals," she says.

Ms. Mills says the concentration of chemical pollutants in marine
Mammals increases as its position in the food chain gets higher. So
micro-organisms carry little contamination; the fish that eat them carry
slightly more, and the build-up continues through the chain to include
predatory fish, seals, walruses, whales and polar bears and, lastly,
humans.

Ms. Mills says land-based animals like caribou are very clean. She says
it is only the organs and fat of marine mammals that concerned individuals
might want to avoid. She says concentrations are bound to be higher in
muktuk, a dish made from seal, walrus or whale fat.

Ultimately, Ms. Mills stresses a calm, sensible approach. That advice is
seconded by Eric Loring, environmental wildlife coordinator with the
Inuit Tapirisat of Canada. The Tapirisat is an organization that
represents Canadian Inuit.

"We don't really know what the effects of the contamination are, and
that's the problem," Loring said Thursday.

Both Mills and Loring stressed the importance of not scaring people
away from country food, while they continue their research and lobbying
efforts to turn off the global "chemical tap."

"I would say right now it's more of a health risk to not eat country
food than to eat it," Loring said, "because it contains vitamins and
nutrients that they would never find in store-bought food."

Both Mills, who is of Gwich'in descent, and Loring stressed the
importance of country food to aboriginal peoples' sense of identity.

"It's important as a cultural activity -- so much so that at the ITC
office every day for lunch we have raw seal, fish, caribou or berries," said
Loring. "We have access to the same great supermarkets as anyone else
in Ottawa, but this is our healthy choice."

"Bedouin ways are hard, even for those brought up in them and for strangers, terrible: a death in life. No man can live this life and emerge unchanged. He will carry, however faint, the imprint of the desert, the brand which marks the nomad; and he will have within him the yearning to return, weak or insistent according to his nature. For this cruel land can cast a spell which no temperate clime can match."

- T.E. Lawrence (Lawrence of Arabia) 
While adventurer Jamie Clarke was crossing the world s harshest desert, he often thought his 1997 trip up Mount Everest had been easier.

"I ll never cross the Rub al-Khaly again," said the adventurer from Calgary, Alberta of his 39-day trek across the Arabian desert.

"But I d climb Everest."

Clarke spoke from the comfort of a hotel room in Abu Dhabi and recalled the desert s challenges: threatening quicksand, mountainous sand dunes and blazing heat.

Halfway through the journey, Clarke thought his chances of completing the trek were slim.

But he and his team fought frustration, thirst, sandstorms and a scorching sun to make the 1,200-km journey that took them from Oman, through Saudi Arabia and into the United Arab Emirates.

Not only did the six-man, 12-camel team make it, they beat their own deadline by three days.

"We are tired, thirsty and hungry, but ecstatic to be here," Clarke said.

Clarke and two other Calgary residents, his brother Leigh and friend Bruce Kirkby, set out Feb. 2 from Salalah, Oman, along with three Bedouin guides and their camels. On March 12, they reached Abu
Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates. They became the first Westerners in more than fifty years to cross the severe Arabian desert.

"The first thing I did when I came to the hotel was open the tap and pour a glass of cold water," Clarke said. "In the desert, you had to be really thirsty to drink water stored in goat skin." He described the stored water, which became contaminated with goat hair and fat, as tasting like "watered chocolate milk." He
marvels at how lucky we are to be able to drink from a tap.

There are no permanent roads or settlements in the desert, which covers 300,000 square kilometres of southern Arabia. It has been a lure to adventurers since British traveller Wilfred Thesiger crossed it in 1947 and wrote about his journey.

Daytime temperatures reached 49 degrees Celsius, with the sand even hotter: 80 degrees Celsius. At night, the temperature fell as low as nine degrees.

"Before the journey, for months, all I thought about was being in the desert. I dreamt about it," Clarke said. "When I got there, I couldn t wait to finish."

Clarke said his relationship with the camels left an lasting mark on him.

"The camel became part of me. I became part of the camel. Listening to it, feeling it, becomes an extension of you because your life depends on it."

He added that "you have to be nice to it, you have to talk softly and show your love" or you ll be trying to work with a grumpy, screaming beast.

The trek left the men with blistered skin, chapped lips and less weight. Each lost at least 11 pounds.

Clarke and his team sent reports and photos about their trip by satellite phone to a Web site that drew more than three million visitors.

"The kids were a great motivation, I felt they were cheering us on.

"I wouldn't advise someone to go there for 40 days. Maybe three, four days tops."
Stanley Faulder was executed by the State of Texas yesterday evening.

After 22 years on death row, the Alberta native became the first
Canadian to be executed in the U.S. since 1952. He was sentenced to
death for the 1975 murder of a Texas woman.

A last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court to stop the execution was
rejected, and Texas Governor George W. Bush said he would not issue a
stay of execution. A "stay of execution" delays the execution, and would
have allowed Mr. Faulder's lawyer to continue her quest to allow him to
live.

The United States placed itself above international law, says a friend
of the late man's family.

"The United States is one of our world leaders and world powers, and yet
they allow the basic human rights of people to be violated in their own
country," said Charlene Gingera, about an hour after Faulder was killed
by an injection of deadly chemicals.

Ms. Gingera spoke on behalf of family members who wanted to grieve
Faulder's death privately.

She was referring to the fact that both Canada's Foreign Affairs
Minister Lloyd Axworthy and his U.S. counterpart, Madeleine Albright,
agreed Faulder was denied his international rights because Texas
officials failed to tell Canadian diplomats that he was in jail. Most
countries in the world have agreed that this must be done when they
arrest a citizen of another country.

Texas Governor and presidential candidate George W. Bush refused to
grant a stay of the execution, saying there was no new evidence
that questioned the jury's verdict in the death of Inez Phillips, who
Faulder was convicted of killing in 1977.

"Had Stan Faulder been a Texan in Iran or Serbia and he was not notified
of his right to seek help from the U.S. consulate had he
been detained, would the U.S.A. tolerate it? I don't think so," Ms.
Gingera says.

"They are undermining international law by saying that Texas has to go
ahead with what they believe to be right."

Ms. Gingera has been working with the Faulder family since 1997 to try
to get human rights groups interested in the case.

She acknowledges that Americans fighting the death penalty are just a
few small voices.

But she adds: "I think Stan's death will certainly be a loud voice.
There are many people from around the world who responded to
his case and that will not go unheard."

Ms. Gingera says she was alarmed by comments from Alberta Reform Member
of Parliament Cliff Breitkreuz, who wanted Texas officials to ignore the
argument that Mr. Faulder's rights were violated when he wasn't told he
could contact Canadian consular officials when he was charged with
murder.

"It's frightening to see people like... Cliff Breitkreuz and various
people in the province of Alberta or Canada who say it's OK to ignore a
violation of international law, it's OK to ignore a violation of human
rights...."

She says while Faulder's supporters struggled with their anger Thursday,
the inmate himself was peaceful.

"Stan's peace had really spread to many people and his peace truly
helped his friends and family around him to be filled with a
sense of peace."

In the last few days, Mr. Faulder's relatives had hoped for a stay of
execution but they weren't overly optimistic, she says.

"They did know that this was something that could really happen."

Canada does not execute prisoners.
The federal government has plans to take a new look at the use of
marijuana for people who are suffering from painful diseases such as
cancer, AIDS and multiple sclerosis.

All use of marijuana is now illegal in Canada. But if a scientific study
of the drug shows that it can help relieve pain in some people, it could
be legalized for medical use only.

Marijuana is the common name of Cannabis sativa, a plant which contains
more than 400 chemicals. What is commonly referred to as marijuana
("grass", "pot", "weed") in North America is usually made up of crushed
cannabis leaves, flowers, and often twigs.

Health Minister Allan Rock announced yesterday that his department is
putting together guidelines for a scientific look at marijuana. The
study would examine how the drug should be administered, and how a safe
supply could be distributed to patients.

"There are people who are dying," Mr. Rock said. "They want access to
something they believe will help with their symptoms. We want to help."

The Health Department has already consulted with the Food and Drug
Administration in the United States -- which is also planning similar
trials -- about acquiring marijuana for the tests.

Making marijuana available to patients by prescription will not mean
changes to the criminal code. Marijuana could be administered under an
existing section of the Food and Drug Act, which allows for special
access to prohibited substances.

The belief that marijuana eases pain in some patients has been growing
-- although people continue to face criminal charges across Canada even
when they claim to be using it for medical purposes.

THC (delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol) is the main psychoactive part of
marijuana. When marijuana is smoked, THC is absorbed from the lungs to
the bloodstream within minutes.

Mark Crossley is a 38-year-old Nova Scotia man with an inoperable brain
tumour.  He was sentenced last week to four months of house arrest and
18 months probation for growing marijuana in his backyard. He said he
received the sentence even after the court was told he smoked the drug
to deal with the painful headaches and appetite loss caused by his
cancer. His doctor approved.

Mr. Rock said his announcement is not a step toward a widespread
legalization of the drug.

"This has nothing to do with legalizing marijuana," he said. But he
added, "I think Canadians support on a compassionate basis, if someone
is dying, access to a substance that could alleviate their suffering."

An Edmonton doctor who specializes in pain management agrees with the
federal government's move.  Doctor Helen Hays studied a patient who
smoked marijuana to fight the symptoms of a painful muscle disorder.
"There was a tremendous improvement," she said. She also says that
smoking marijuana brings its own side effects and doesn't work for
everyone. "We all need to know an awful lot more about it."

Doctors can currently prescribe a synthetic form of marijuana, but it is
expensive, and many patients complain that oral forms of the drug
don't work as well as smoking it.

Several American states have already approved the medical use of
marijuana. It was taken to a vote in seven U.S. states and the District
of Columbia.

A similar bill was also recently presented in the British House of
Commons in London.
Canadian bombs hit their targets during NATO's initial attacks on
war-torn Yugoslavia, officials announced yesterday. The announcement was
made before the CF-18 jets had returned from a second round of battle.

Four of the fighter bombers from Bagotville, Quebec returned
safely to their Italian base late Thursday after a second day of air
strikes aimed at ending ethnic bloodshed in the province of Kosovo.

"The guys are back and they're safe," Captain David Muralt said
from Aviano. "They seem to be in pretty good spirits and we're
pretty happy to see them back. Everybody's a little expectant when
they're gone."

In Ottawa, Ontario, officials gave the first descriptions of Canada's
role
in Wednesday's lead wave.

"There were four aircraft and they had four separate targets,"
said lieutenant-general Ray Henault, deputy chief of defence staff.
"Three of the four targets assigned to our aircraft were hit.

"One of the pilots was unable to positively identify the target
that he had been assigned and, as a measure and a mark of excellent
discipline, he didn't launch his weapons."

There were no immediate damage estimates.

Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy has said the goal is to
force Yugoslavia to accept a peace agreement proposed by the United
States. It
would allow ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to govern themselves.

That is what seems to lie at the heart of the conflict. The government
of Yugoslavia -- which is mostly Serbian -- does not want to allow the
region of Kosovo, where most of the residents are of Albanian heritage,
to rule themselves.   

"We are trying to deliver the message that military force against
civilians is not acceptable," Mr. Axworthy said in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

"The targets are those that are military and every effort is
being made to keep whatever other casualties to a minimum."

"We are trying to stop a humanitarian disaster," Defence
Minister Art Eggleton told the House of Commons. "We must, in fact,
ensure
that this genocide comes to an end."

Yugoslavia is thought to have dangerous air defences,
including surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns.

Over the past three days Serbian Canadians and anti-war demonstrators
have been holding protests in a number of Canadian cities. Tomorrow
there will be a demonstration in front of the House of Commons.
The world lost a basketball hero this week -- and we're not talking
about Michael Jordan.

You may not know her name, but Noella "Babe" MacLean, who died this week
at age 87, was one of Canada's biggest sports stars.  She was a member
of the "winningest" basketball team Canada ever had.  But unlike retired
millionaire Jordan, Babe never made a cent for her skills.

Her team was known as the Edmonton Grads. None of the members of the
team expected to do as well as they did.  They were just a group of
young women from the same school who liked to play basketball.

Their coach was  teacher J. Percy Page, who later became the Lieutenant
Governor of Alberta.  Their home base was  McDougall Commercial High
School in Edmonton.   For 25 years -- from 1915 to 1940 -- they brought
great honour to Canada and their home city , Edmonton.

When they finally retired, the Grads had 108 championships to their
credit. They won at all levels--local, regional, national, international

and world.   Of the 522 games they played they won 502!   The inventor
of the game of basketball, Dr. James Naismith called the Edmonton Grads
"the finest basketball team that ever stepped out on a floor".

Babe Belanger played with the Grads from 1929 to 1937.  She was a
forward and she stood only 5 feet, 2 inches tall. In those days,
marriage meant an end to a young women's career. Babe Belanger married
Ian MacLean, who continued the family sports tradition. He later became
a trainer for Edmonton hockey teams and the Edmonton Eskimos and B.C.
Lions football teams.

Babe never talked about her fabulous career. But her daughter says the
scrapbooks she found in the family's basement show she was a part of a
team that was every bit as sensational as the Edmonton Oilers in
Gretzky's time.
Students who lock lips in the hallways of Winnipeg's Sisler High School have been warned: if that friendly peck gets too passionate, they couldbe sent home or even suspended.

With Valentine's Day just around the corner, vice-principal Mike Kachmar announced the smooching ban over the school's public address system.

He says students are expected to treat each other with courtesy and respect, and that doesn't include passionate embracing in the hall.

"School is a place of business and we expect students to act and behave accordingly," Kachmar says.

Kachmar says he made the announcement after receiving complaints about a few students whose intense kissing was making others uncomfortable.

Jeffrey Besyk is in Grade 12. He says he has never witnessed a problem in Sisler's hallways, and he says the school shouldn't regulate what students do when they're not in class.

"Class is for learning, as the principals say, but when it comes to our breaks, those are our time, and I think we should be able to do what we want," says Besyk.

Kissing has a long history in Western civilization, with references dating back to the Old Testament.

The ancient Greeks and Romans Early Christians greeted one another with a kiss, and this "holy kiss" is still a part of Roman Catholic rituals, such as when a bishop kisses a newly ordained priest. Medieval knights were kissed after being knighted, and the custom of kissing the bride remains almost universal in Western marriage ceremonies.

Until the 20th century, kissing was rarely practiced in East Asia, where bowing was the all-purpose form of greeting, and kissing was left for private moments.
Residents of Baffin Island are getting ready to celebrate one of
Canada's most unique festivals: the unpacking of the sealift delivery. 
For days the air in towns like Iqaluit will be filled with the sounds of
banging hammers and ripping cardboard as the goods they ordered from
southern Canada finally arrive by ship.

Mild temperatures across the eastern Arctic have produced ideal
conditions for the 1999 sealift, moving sailing schedules for many
communities forward by several weeks.

Environment Canada is forecasting early ice break-up as shippers prepare
to carry out the annual resupply of building materials, non-perishable
food, cars, snowmobiles and boats.

During the long winter months food supplies can only arrive by airplane.
Food can cost from twice to three times what it does down south.

Northerners are used to paying more than two dollars for a can of pop, 
more than a dollar for an apple and three dollars for a litre of milk. 
Believe it or not, a simple head of wilted lettuce can cost five
dollars.

But large, heavy items cannot be transported by airplane. So northern
residents order what they need by catalogue or telephone or the
Internet, and wait for the ships to arrive in the spring.

"El Nino as you know lasted well into the winter last year, and we've
had above normal temperatures the whole winter in the eastern Arctic and
Hudson Bay," says Rick Power, a spokesman for the Canadian Ice Service.
"So the ice didn't thicken as much as normal in most areas, and it
started to clear a little earlier.

"And of course we've had a very mild spring as well."

Environment Canada's outlook for ice break-up and clearing patterns
predicts smooth sailing in much of James Bay, Hudson Bay and Hudson
Strait by the first week of July -- a month earlier than normal. Across
the Arctic, ice break-up is expected to be three weeks early, on
average.

Colin Crosbie, vice-president of Nunavut Ocean Transport, and veteran of
the northern sealift, described this year's ice conditions as
unprecedented.

"I have been involved in shipping in the Arctic since 1969 and certainly
nobody I've talked to who had been up there for decades before had ever
seen anything like this," he says. "Five years ago, if we had said we
were going to Iqaluit June 25 people would say, 'you're crazy.'"

The extended sealift season is a blessing for the booming construction
industry in Nunavut, Canada's newest territory.

This year, Iqaluit is very scarce on materials, so the fact that it's
going to open up early is a positive thing," says Suzanne Paquin,
vice-president of Nunavut Eastern Arctic Shipping said.
A group of 50 beluga whales is fighting to stay alive in an icy trap in
the Canadian Arctic near Ellesmere Island.

An unexpected freeze has left dozens of the whales trapped in a sea of
ice, with one small hole as their only window for air. The open sea is
20 kilometres away.

About 20 of them have already died, despite the best efforts of wildlife
officials. The reason: polar bears. With the whales swarming their only
air hole, they've become easy prey for the bears.

The polar bears are hunting the belugas at will. Even in the best of
conditions, belugas can only spend about 10 minutes underwater. When
they come up, the bears jump onto the whales and tear chunks out of
them.

Unless the ice breaks up soon, the belugas' chances of survival are
grim. 

Beluga whales live only in the arctic and subarctic. They live in the
Arctic Ocean and its adjoining seas, including the Sea of Okhotsk, the
Bering Sea, the Gulf of Alaska, the Beaufort Sea, Baffin Bay, Hudson
Bay, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
Devastating tornadoes too numerous to count roared across the American
states of Oklahoma and Kansas late yesterday. At least 46 people were
killed and hundreds were left injured and homeless.

A tornado is an extremely violent windstorm that is usually created
within a thunderstorm or hurricane. The recognizable shape of the
tornado is the swirling funnel cloud that extends from the base of a
storm cloud to the ground.

The Oklahoma state medical examiner said 40 people were killed in
Oklahoma alone in Monday's storms, the largest of which formed about 110
kilometres southwest of Oklahoma City - cutting a path at least a
kilometre wide as it moved north and east.

About 400 kilometres miles north, a tornado spawned by the same storm
system tossed mobile homes like tin cans, damaged houses and killed at
least five people in Wichita, Kansas and its suburb of Haysville.
Hospitals reported treating more than 80 people.

Fred Irvin of the Sedgwick County Emergency Preparedness Office said
today that the initial count of 10 deaths proved wrong when authorities
realized victims had been counted twice. But authorities still fear more
dead will be found.

"It is worse than what you can see," says Bob Thompson, a battalion
chief for the Sedgwick County Fire Department. "We'll probably find
more deaths."

The storm system began in southwest Oklahoma and moved into the
neighboring state of Kansas. It included several tornadoes, one of which was nearly two kilometres wide at times.

Witnesses say the twister was like a huge white train that came crashing
through their homes.

Chad Harris was with seven people inside his mobile home in Haysville
when it was flipped over and demolished. Two of his companions were
critically injured.

"I have no trailer," Harris said. "We all rolled in it. It was the
worst experience in my life."

The Oklahoma City twister is ranked as an F-4 tornado, the
second-strongest classification.

An F-4 tornado has a wind speed of 333-419 kilometres per hour. It can
level well-constructed houses, structures with weak foundations can be
blown off some distance, cars are thrown and objects like trees can
become airborne like missiles.

Scientists rank tornadoes on the Fujita scale of intensity, named after
a University of Chicago researcher. On average, only one F-5 tornado hits the United States each year.
A middle school in Liverpool, Nova Scotia is pumping up bodies as well
as minds.

It's an example of a school teaming up with the community to raise
money. South Queens Junior High School is taking aim at the fitness
market.

The school has turned its one-time metal shop - lost to budget cuts
almost two years ago - into a money-making professional fitness club.
The club will be open seven days a week.

The club, operated by a non-profit society made up of school and
community volunteers, has sold more than 30 memberships and hired a
full-time co-ordinator.

Principal Betty Jean Aucoin says the club is a first for a Nova Scotia
public school. She says the school took it on itself to provide a
service needed in Liverpool.

"We don't have any athletic facilities here on the South Shore of Nova
Scotia, so if we don't use our schools, communities such as Queens are
going to be struggling to get anything going," Aucoin said.

More than a $100,000 was raised through fund-raising and donations from
government, Sport Nova Scotia, and two local companies.

Some people are wondering if the ties between the businesses and the
school are too close. Schools are not set up to make profits or promote
businesses.  

Southwest Regional School Board superintendent Ann Jones says there's no
fear the lines between education and business are blurring.

"First call on any school facility belongs to... the youngsters in the
school," says Ann Jones.

The 12,000-square-foot club has seven aerobic machines, including
treadmills, steppers, and stationary bicycles, as well as weight
machines and freeweights.

Memberships cost $180 a year for adults and $135 for students and
seniors.

Proceeds pay the salary of the centre co-ordinator and upkeep of the
facility.
An act of racism against an aboriginal hockey team and its fans is the latest of many that have stained the sport, Native leaders said Thursday.

"It s not the first incident," said Rod Bushie, grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs. "It s happening right across this province."

On Monday night, visiting Native spectators and players discovered racist pamphlets on their bus seats following a Manitoba Junior Hockey League game in the northwestern town of Dauphin, Manitoba.

The OCN Blizzards of the Opaskwayak Cree Nation had beaten the hometown Dauphin Kings in a playoff game.

The unsigned flyers suggested that First Nations people love welfare and hate white people because "they have brand new cars  nice homes... and new clothes."

Bushie said there have been other incidents, including racist remarks made by fans and parents of opposing teams.

Two weeks ago at a Bantam hockey game in Dauphin involving a team from Waywayseecappo First Nation, fans for the other team brought hand drums to the game to taunt the Native players and fans, Bushie
said.

"If you have a whole month, we can give you a list," he said. "We re fed up with it."

Dauphin RCMP are investigating the latest incident.

Bushie called on politicians to encourage racial tolerance. He suggested more aboriginal education in schools.

He wants Manitoba Hockey and the MJHL to investigate acts of racism. League commissioner Frank McKinnon could not be reached for comment.

Dauphin Mayor Bill Nicholson said he has apologized to First Nations leaders and has invited them to discuss the matter with city council on April 12.
There is more very sad news in the story about thirteen year old Tyrell
Dueck of Martinsville, Saskatchewan. 

Last Thursday CBC4Kids explained why Saskatchewan Judge A. R. Rothery
would not allow Tyrell to refuse cancer treatment. Justice Rothery said
that it was in Tyrell's best interest to continue with chemotherapy even
if he and his family were opposed. 

Tyrell was examined by doctors in Saskatoon on Friday. They were getting
ready to follow the judge's orders and continue treating Tyrell.  
Instead the doctors discovered that cancer has spread from Tyrell's leg
into his lungs. It has all but ended his chance of recovery.
"Tyrell's legal battles are over. The matter is most certainly
in the hands of God, if it ever were in the hands of mortals,"
the Duecks' lawyer Owe Girths told a stunned crowd of supporters
on Sunday.

Doctors have told Tyrell they can do nothing more for him. He spent a
quiet weekend at home as his family considered what to do now.

"He is suffering with some pain in his knee. The doctors have
given him some pain control for that but he maintains the quiet
confidence in his God that he has had since the beginning of this
thing," Mr. Girths said.

Tyrell first discovered a lump on his leg around his birthday, October
1, after he slipped in the shower. Bone cancer was diagnosed.

He and his family fought to avoid standard cancer therapy, consisting of
chemotherapy and at least the partial amputation of his leg.
Chemotherapy consists of putting various chemicals into the body to
destroy the cancer.

The Dueck family are fundamentalist Christians and wanted to send the
boy to Mexico for alternative treatment, which would include herbs and
large doses of vitamins, and rely on the power of prayer.

Saskatchewan's Social Services Department went to court twice to
force the boy to submit to traditional treatment. Last week, a judge
ordered
Tyrell to resume treatment but the family planned to appeal.

But none of that matters with the new diagnosis. Saskatchewan Social
Services
was to go to court this week to lift all the orders involving the
boy's treatment.

The boy's doctor has said only 10 per cent of patients survive
with his form of cancer, a rare osteosarcoma, once it has moved into
the lungs.

Mr. Griffiths said Tyrell's parents Tim and Yvonne no longer harbour
anger about being dragged through the courts while their son's
illness worsened.

"There was perhaps momentary resentment but there is no longer
any resentment on their part. They believe that this has all
unfolded as God would have it unfold," says Mr. Griffiths.

Other family members who heard yesterday's announcement weren't so
sure.

"I think Tyrell would not be in the situation he is today if
Social Services had not stepped in two months ago," said Kevin
Hildebrandt, Tyrell's uncle.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) says 14,000 of its
soldiers have entered the southern Yugoslavian province of Kosovo in the
last 48 hours.

This is the result of the agreement to end the war between NATO and the
Yugoslav government led by President Slobodan Milosevic. The NATO troops
are there to make sure that Yugoslavian soldiers leave the area. At
least 10,000 Serbian soldiers and police have already left, along with
all Serb military aircraft.

But as NATO troops pour into the province, many of its residents feel
they must leave.

Clutching teddy bears, pet dogs and rifles, citizens of Serbian heritage
streamed out of Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest city today.

Many of them are afraid of the anger of their neighbours of Albanian
heritage. They fear that when the ethnic Albanians return to the area
now that the war is over, they may try to take revenge on the ethnic
Serbs.

With belongings lashed to the top of their cars, the new refugees said
they were heading northwards to the Kosovo capital of Pristina or all
the way to Serbia itself. Many were lifelong residents of Prizren.

"We don't know where we are going. NATO can't guarantee our safety,"
said one man, his family gathered around a packed car as it prepared to
join waves of people that began leaving today.

"War is terrible," said a mother, her daughter preparing to put the
family dog Licky into one of a line of cars jamming a cobblestone
hillside street. On a nearby square, passengers climbed aboard a bus
bound for Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.

There was no harassment from ethnic Albanian residents of Prizren, who
like others across Kosovo, say they suffered looting, humiliation and
expulsion at the hands of the Serb military and police.

"This is not a fight between Albanians and Serbs. We have long lived
together. Many of us wept when they were forced to leave," said the
theology professor. "This is the politics of communism, of President
Slobodan Milosevic."

Thirteen hundred Canadian soldiers will participate in the occupation of
Kosovo. Five hundred of them come from the Princess Patricia Canadian
Light Infantry in Edmonton. They will serve with a British armoured
brigade. Canadian troops are as well serving on a ship, the HMCS
Athabascan, which is sailing in the Adriatic Sea, just off the coast
of Yugoslavia.

NATO spokesman Jamie Shea says troop deployment is going "very smoothly"
and is slightly ahead of schedule. He says Yugoslav troops are sticking
to their timetable for leaving the area and should be out of the
southern sector of Kosovo by tomorrow's deadline. Under the peace
agreement, all Serb forces must have withdrawn by Sunday, June 20.
Church bells around the world rang out at noon yesterday as an
international ban on landmines became international law.

Canada was one of the leading countries behind the ban.

In Melbourne, Australia bells rang at Saint Michael's Uniting Church. In
Brasilia, the capital city of Brazil, anti-landmine pamphlets were
distributed and there were screenings of "Spotlight on a Massacre", an
anti-landmines film in Portuguese. 

In Paris, France members of carillon associations - people who are
experts at ringing bells - coordinated the ringing of cathedral bells
across the city. And there was bell-ringing in approximately 30 Buddhist
temples and Christian churches in 10 cities throughout Japan, including
Hiroshima, Tokyo and Osaka.

The pact was agreed to by 130 countries in Ottawa, Ontario in 1997.
Russia, the United States, China and Ukraine did not sign the treaty.

Despite these notable absences, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jody Williams,
of The
International Campaign to Ban Landmines, says the accord has an impact
for many other countries in the world.

The head of the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi Annan described
the treaty's entry into force as a milestone.

"It is a day whose arrival few could have predicted, and whose import to
the millions whose lives or limbs may be saved from these barbarous
weapons cannot be overestimated," Mr. Annan said.

Pope John Paul added his voice to the effort, urging more countries to
sign the treaty. The treaty prohibits the use, production and storage of
anti-personnel landmines and sets a time limit for destroying stocks and
clearing mine fields.

There are two categories of landmines: antipersonnel (AP) and
antitank or anti-vehicle (AT):

-Anti-personnel (AP) landmine - "A mine designed to be
exploded by the presence, proximity or contact of a person
and that will incapacitate, injure or kill one or more
persons." 
-Anti-tank (AT) landmine - An AT mine is a device
designed to detonate by more than 100 kilograms of
pressure. AT mines cannot distinguish between a tank and
tractor

The United States has refused to sign the treaty, saying it needs the
mines for its defence along the border between North and South Korea.
The governments of North and South Korea have been in constant conflict
for more then 40 years.   

Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy spearheaded the
political initiative to get the treaty ratified.

"For us, this is a very important day," Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy said. He said the treaty is a stepping stone to furthering what
he calls the human security agenda.

The challenge now, he said, is to make the pact work.
Pastor Ken Gartly provided comfort and prayer to people in Taber,
Alberta yesterday after two students were shot at the town's high
school.

Students at W.R. Myers high school had just settled down after lunch
when a 14-year-old boy walked in and shot two students, killing one. The
shooting comes a week after the shooting tragedy at Columbine high
school in Littleton, Colorado.

"We have a son and daughter-in-law in Denver," says Pastor Gartly after
an evening service at Taber Evangelical Free Church where worshipers
discussed the day's tragic events.

The dead teenager has been identified as Jason Lang, 17. The other
victim, Shane Christmas, also 17, had emergency surgery yesterday at
Lethbridge Regional Hospital. This morning his condition was reported as
fair to serious. The two grade 11 students were said to be best friends.

Eight thousand people live in Taber, which is 300 kilometres southeast
of Calgary. Many members of the community are members of the Mormon
Church or are evangelical Christians.

Taber was founded at the beginning of the century. It is mainly made up
of decendents of the area's early homestead pioneers, of Central
European, Polish, Japanese, Dutch and various other racial backgrounds.
Many Japanese came in 1943, Polish war veterans in 1947, and many Dutch
immigrants came after about 1950. Many native Canadians also live in the
region.

"You feel pain for the families, the young fellow who was shot and
killed is a son of people we've gotten to know, his father is a pastoral
colleague," said Mr. Gartly.

"Our youth pastor spent 45 minutes with the youth group tonight. But we
believe it's important to pray and we're certainly praying for those
involved.

"We prayed for the family that lost a son, we prayed for a family that
has a son in critical condition, we prayed for the fellow responsible
and we prayed for ourselves that we can relate to people in a way that
can comfort, encourage and help them."

The evening event at the church was a scheduled visit of a choir from
Providence College and Seminary in Otterburn, Manitoba. The group is on
a tour of Alberta and British Columbia and were unaware of the day's
events when they arrived in Taber.

Gartly said he and the group sat down and modified the original program
to make it relevant to the shootings at the high school.

"People asked for guidance in what to say to the kids, and one high
school girl asked for people to reach out to God."

Police confirmed the gunman was taken into custody by the school
resource officer, who is also a member of the Taber Police Service.
Violent demonstrations by angry Kurds took place around the world
yesterday following the arrest of rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan.

Ocalan leads a separatist group that has fought for the creation of an
independent Kurdistan. Kurds live in lands controlled by Turkey, Iran,
Iraq and Syria. An estimated 20,000 people have died in the fighting of
the past 15 years.

In London, England, the Greek embassy was temporarily occupied, and
hundreds of Kurds are continuing to protest outside the embassy.

In Ottawa on Wednesday, Kurdish demonstrators hurled a gasoline bomb at
a police line, setting one officer on fire. The group of 400 protesters
was fighting with a riot squad outside the Turkish Embassy. In all, 10
police officers were injured in the fighting.

In Greece, the foreign minister, the interior minister and the public
order minister handed in their resignations because they failed to
protect the Kurdish rebel leader.

Ocalan was captured earlier this week while hiding in the Greek embassy
in Kenya.

Turkey considers Ocalan an enemy because he's been fighting an ongoing
battle for a separate Kurdish homeland. He could face the death penalty.

Ocalan's supporters have been protesting at Turkish, Greek and Israeli
embassies in Europe and Canada. 

On Wednesday, after rumours that Israel helped Turkish securities forces
capture Ocalan, angry Kurds tried to occupy the Israeli consulate in
Berlin. Israeli guards opened fire on the protesters, killing three and
injuring 16 others. 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to calm Kurdish
anger. But he defends the killings and says his nation had nothing to do
with Ocalan's arrest.

In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told the Kurds they must obey
German laws and stop violent protests -- or they will be thrown out of
the country.

In Turkey, police have reportedly arrested hundreds of supporters of the
main Kurdish party, while up to 4,000 soldiers have been sent into
Northern Iraq to attack Kurdish rebel bases.

Ocalan has lived outside Turkey since 1980. In recent months, Turkey has
exerted diplomatic pressure on European countries to hand the rebel
leader over for trial. Syria, Lebanon, Russia, the Netherlands and
Italy, among others, had expelled him.       
Air-raid warning sirens sounded in the Kosovo capital of Pristina this
morning. Yugoslavia is bracing for air strikes by NATO forces.

Reporters say the siren lasted about 90 seconds. There was a brief pause
before the siren sounded again.

Yugoslav authorities have declared a state of emergency. They are
getting ready for war. They've shut down the country's main independent
radio station and they're preparing shelters for the civilian
population.

This is happening because the coalition of countries that are members of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organizatoin (NATO) want to stop the
Yugoslavians from invading the neighbouring region of Kosovo.

Kosovo is a province of Serbia, which is one of the republics that make
up Yugoslavia. Ninety per cent of Kosovo's population are ethnic
Albanians, who have been pushing for independence from Serbia.
Brigadier-General Michel Maisonneuve is the senior Canadian Forces
officer who has been serving with NATO. He adds that "Kosovo is a
beautiful part of Yugoslavia. It is relatively flat, with mountains
surrounding it, as well as a spine that runs up the middle. The province
is in large majority ethnic Albanian, with many other minorities,
including Serbs, gypsies, Turks,
etc. The people are hospitable and hardy."

The conflict that is being played out today has roots that go back
hundreds and hundreds of years.

In 1389, Serbs lost a key battle against the forces of the invading
Ottoman Empire on the fields of Kosovo. The defeat marks the beginning
of the end of Serbia's Medieval Empire. Kosovo became part of the
Ottoman Empire. In the following centuries that battle become the key
event in Serbian and Albanian national history.

Over the last decade there have been many attempts at a peaceful
settlement.

Representatives of the NATO countries have tried to negotiate with the
government of Yugoslavia. Those negotions failed earlier this week. NATO
says that bombing Yugoslavia is the only way to get them to stop their
assault on Kosovo.  

The question is no longer if, but when, NATO will begin bombing. 

NATO Secretary General Javier Solana assured Yugoslovia's neighbours
today that the alliance would protect them in the event of attacks by
Yugoslavia.

Yugoslav officials say they might not be able to win a war against
NATO, but they feel they can inflict serious damage. 
NATO military planners aren't taking the threats lightly.

Few people believe that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is ready
to give in. He opposes outside interference in Kosovo. The Yugoslav
leader insists the problems in Kosovo are an internal Yugoslav matter.
He refuses to allow any outside force into Kosovo to monitor any peace
agreement.

If NATO strikes proceed, Canadians will be involved.
There are about 130 Canadian Forces personnel and six
CF-18 fighter aircraft based in Aviano, Italy who will likely
participate.
The woman who charged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for war
crimes has been appointed to Canada's Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court is Canada's highest court. Louise Arbour will become
the high court's third female justice when she begins her new job in
September.

Justice Minister Anne McLellan says the 52-year-old Arbour is perfect
for the job and will replace retired justice Peter Cory quite nicely.

Ms. McLellan says Judge Arbour will make sure the tribunal continues to
pursue its cases against Milosevic and his fellow accused ministers. She
says Judge Arbour's work prosecuting war crimes would enhance the
Supreme Court, describing her as "a woman
who has dealt with some of the most difficult and challenging issues of
our modern time.

"I think it is unquestioned that she will make a singular contribution
to the highest court in the land."

Judge Arbour's last major act as chief prosecutor was to indict Slobodan
Milosevic for crimes against humanity two weeks ago -- the first time an
international court has charged a sitting head of state with war crimes.
She held the Yugoslav President personally responsible, along with four
of his aides, for the horrors in Kosovo and the brutal purge of ethnic
Albanians.

It appears to be no coincidence that Ms. McLellan announced the
appointment the day after NATO and Yugoslav generals signed a detailed
military agreement on the withdrawal of Yugoslav and Serb forces from
Kosovo. The government was very aware of how tricky it would be to take
her away from her high-profile assignment of prosecuting Milosevic.

Judge Arbour will not start work until September 15th.

Judge Arbour is seen as having a sound knowledge of the law, coupled
with an understanding of the practical implications that judgments have
on people. Her multitude of friends describe her as legally brilliant,
charming, and possessed of a common touch.

"Louise Arbour is a down-to-earth individual, who understands the needs
of the ordinary person," says lawyer Earl Levy.

Judge Arbour graduated from the University of Montreal with a law degree
in 1970.

In 1995, she headed an inquiry into the mistreatment of women in the
Prison for Women in Kingston, Ontario. In 1996, she was appointed to her
position as chief prosecutor at the war-crimes tribunal.
This morning at 6:48 Eastern Daylight Time, Julie Payette's 25-year-old
dream came true. She blasted off into space aboard the Space Shuttle
Discovery.

The 35-year-old Quebecer has wanted to go to space since she was 10.

She had a poster of Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon,
on her bedroom wall.

"I was fascinated by those trips the astronauts made to the moon, by
their space suits, by their experiences, the equipment they used --
especially the lunar module and the lunar vehicle," she says.

"I wanted to be like them. I wanted to be an astronaut."

Believe it or not, at school Julie used to skip recess so she could do
her homework. And she used to exercise so much she would make herself
sick. "I had trouble getting her to stop working," says Sister Yolande
Perrault, who was her French teacher. "I would tell her, 'Julie, take a
break.'"

Now all that work has paid off.

Along with being an astronaut, Julie is a computer engineer, can speak 5
languages (French, English, German, Spanish and Russian), has competed
in triathalon races (swimming, running, and biking), is a deep-sea
diver, and has a jet pilot's licence. Julie is also interested in the
arts - she plays the piano and is a soprano singer.

Julie's space dream finally began to come true last year when she was
selected for mission STS-96, which was supposed to launch on May 20th,
1999. But fulfilment of her dream had to wait until today, after a hail
storm damaged the insulation on the Discovery's fuel tanks a few days
before the scheduled launch.

Although she will not be the first Canadian woman in space, she will be
the first Canadian astronaut to enter and work on the International
Space Station platform, launched last year by the United States and
Russia.

Her tasks will include unloading and arranging the 2,200 kilograms of
equipment being carried to the station for future astronauts; working
the remote-control Canadarm while supervising crew members constructing
parts of the station, and documenting the mission's progress with video
cameras.

Julie will also have to help change the 18 solar batteries on the
station module Zarya. Each battery is roughly the size of a cellular
phone. That task will be undertaken with Russian astronaut Valery
Tokarev. To make sure the job is done correctly, Payette learned Russian
so she could communicate with Tokarev.

She has been training for the mission since 1992, when she was first
selected to be an astronaut by the Canadian Space Agency.

Prime Minister Jean Chretien paid tribute to the Montrealer as a credit
to the space program and the country.

"I'm telling you she's creating a great impression in the land. She's
very young, very articulate and perfectly bilingual and she's showing
the Canadian colours with pride and dignity and we should pray for her
that everything will be all right, and it will be," said Mr. Chretien

Aline Chretien, the Prime Minister's wife, was invited by Julie Payette
to watch the launch in Florida.

Yesterday evening Aline Chretien told her husband that her friend was
"starting to have butterflies."

"I guess I would have a few, too, sitting on that much power," said the
Prime Minister.
Gisborne Lake looks much like any other lake on the barrens of southern
Newfoundland. But it is about to become the source of a $35-million
water project -- and a free-trade controversy.

Gerry White has a plan to build a pipeline from Gisborne Lake to the
neighbouring community of Grand Lepierre, where it will be pumped into
waiting tankers and shipped overseas.

For months Ottawa and the provinces have been trying to negotiate an
agreement banning bulk water exports. That agreement is still a long way
off, and critics think it may never be reached.

"The federal government knows perfectly well that they're in trouble
with this," says Maude Barlow of the Council of Canadians.

She says agreement or no agreement, this plan has to be stopped. "If
they go ahead, then NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) is
triggered. NAFTA then applies to the whole country and there'll be no
way for us to stop American corporations from coming in and helping
themselves to Canadian water all over the country."

But if Ottawa wants to stop Gerry White from shipping Newfoundland water
all over the world, they'll have to act soon.

After two and a half years of environmental impact studies, he says he's
proven the project is safe. "Until such time as we are stopped, we are
going to proceed on and make the project work."
America is mourning the loss of John F. Kennedy Jr, his wife Carolyn
Bessette-Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette.

The three are presumed dead after a plane piloted by John Jr crashed
into the water off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. They
were on their way to the wedding of John Jr's cousin.

Kennedy is the son of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy.

The U.S. coast guard searched all weekend for any sign of the plane or
survivors. On Sunday, they announced the end of the rescue mission.

They have turned the search and rescue mission into one of search and
recovery. This type of change means there is little hope of finding any
survivors. The coast guard now wants to try and locate the crash site,
and find some clues as to how the crash happened.

Investigators have found some items they think came from the plane. A
suitcase belonging Lauren, a prescription bottle with Carolyn's name,
and pieces of a plane similar to Kennedy's were all found in the water.
They also found bits of foam insulation believed to have come from the
airplane.

The Kennedy family is no stranger to tragedy. In 1963, John Jr's
father, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in Dallas.
Other Kennedys, including two of John Jr's cousins and his uncle, also
died under tragic circumstances.

The United States has no royal family, but the Kennedy's are as close as
it gets. Several Kennedy family members have been involved in U.S.
politics, and they have lived most of their lives in the public eye.
Students in Ontario may be wearing uniforms next fall, or dressing for
school in clothes that conform to a province-wide dress code.

It's part of the Ontario government's plan to introduce a common code of
conduct by next September for the province's 2.1 million students from
kindergarten to Grade 12.

Ontario's Education Minister Dave Johnson said students, parents and
teachers will all be asked to discuss their opinions about uniforms
before any final decisions are made.

"Short of a common uniform, there may be a style of dress that may be
appropriate within a school," Johnson said on Tuesday. "There are many
people in the province who feel that uniforms add a tone of authority
and discipline to a school and make for a better learning environment."

The common code of conduct has started with a new safety policy that
requires schools to phone parents to find out why absent students are
missing.

The code would also deal with acceptable language and set out the
punishment for students who smoke, destroy property, steal, distribute
hate material or carry a weapon. These are still up for debate.

Johnson believes stricter discipline at schools will produce students
with better grades and young adults with responsible attitudes.

"If students are dressed in a sloppy manner, that kind of habit and
dress may flow over into their learning habits and make it difficult to
conduct proper teaching," he said.

Ontario Premier Mike Harris, 54, believes the province's kids are not
what they used to be. He said he remembers the times depicted in the
1950s TV sitcom, Leave it to Beaver.

Harris, a former teacher and parent to two young boys, said students
need to learn some respect.

"They need to know what the line is," he said Tuesday. "What's
acceptable and what isn't and that there are consequences for going over
that line."

Swearing at a teacher, for example, might mean suspension, Harris said.
For violence, the punishment could be expulsion.

Marshall Jarvis, head of the Ontario English Catholic Teachers'
Association, said schools already have policies in place to handle
unruly students.

"The school is a microcosm of the society around it. There are students
with serious concerns. However to paint a picture that that's a general
trend across Ontario is not something that I've witnessed," he said.
One of the most miserable parts of childhood is about to disappear from
the hemisphere. 

Measles is on track to being eliminated throughout North and South
America by the turn of the millennium. At least that's the opinion of a
number of health experts.

Last year Canada had only 12 cases of measles, down from about 2,500 in
1995.

"It has been a surprise to me that measles has disappeared as quickly
as it did," says Donald Henderson of the Pan American Health
Organization.

Most children who get measles will have a rash, high fever, cough, runny
nose, and watery eyes.

These symptoms last for 1 or 2 weeks. But measles also causes ear
infections in nearly 1 out of every 10 children who get it. As many as 1
out of 20 children with measles gets pneumonia. And about 1 child in
every 1,000 who get measles will get encephalitis, an inflammation of
the brain that can lead to convulsions, and can leave the child deaf or
mentally disabled.

For every 1,000 children who get measles, 1 or 2 will die from it.
Measles can also make a pregnant woman have a miscarriage or give birth
prematurely.

Anti-measles immunization began in Canada in 1957. Before that virtually
every child went through a bout with the disease.

But the single-dose vaccine was not fully effective. In August 1995 an
advisory committee recommended that all children be given a second dose
of vaccine. The new policy was adopted in all provinces and
territories.

Rubella, commonly referred to as German measles, is a different disease
with similar symptoms. It remains a problem and is one of the next
targets for elimination.

Measles is the latest in a string of successes for childhood vaccination
programs, but experts fear they could be undermined by growing public
suspicion about the risks and side-effects of immunization.

Last year a group of Manitoba parents went to court in an effort to 
block a program to immunize Grade Four students against Hepatitis B.

They lost their court case, but many parents chose not to have their 
children vaccinated, says Robert Pless of the federal Laboratory Centre
for Disease Control.
Winter may be officially over, but two Canadian cities are still getting 
a little taste -- and they are very different ones.

Most of Saint John's Newfoundland is virtually shut down this morning as
a record-setting blizzard continues. Government offices, businesses and, yes, schools aren't opening their doors. Main roads are open, but police are advising people to stay put. There are many local power outages. The runways at the airport are also blocked.
More than 76 centimetres of snow has fallen in Saint John's since the blizzard started yesterday afternoon.

A couple of thousand kilometres west, it is a whole different story.
When a sun-tanned movie-making team flew up to Calgary, Alberta, from
Hollywood, California to film the movie "Snow Day", they thought the
least they could expect from the Great White North was a little snow.

They were wrong.

Calgary didn't get a single snowflake in March so on Sunday, the
crew filming the movie, which stars Chevy Chase, unloaded
450 dump truck loads of snow.

They transformed a Calgary street into a wintry scene
set in Syracuse, New York.

They laid white tarps and carefully placed hay bales to boost the
snow height, then added the transplanted snow.

Set workers then methodically shoveled so it would look just
right.

The street was complete with snowed-in cars, phony icicles
dangling from the eaves of neighbourhood homes and bits of white
felt on some of the roofs.

Sunday's snow was hauled from Canada Olympic Park in the city's
west end, where the movie's creators had been making it artificially.

Ironically, the crew had previously been filming in Edmonton, where
there was lots of snow.

Snow Day, a family comedy, centres on a group of Syracuse kids who try
to extend a magical day off school into a longer vacation.

It also stars Pam Grier, Schuyler Fisk, the 16-year-old daughter
of Sissy Spacek, and John Schneider. Chris Elliott of David Letterman
fame also stars.
Scientists in the Antarctic have discovered some very old dinosaur
bones, including partial skeletons, whole jaws and teeth.

The remains include the bones of two giant water dinosaurs: the
mosasaur, a razor-toothed "duck-bill" animal with paddles, and the
plesiosaur, which scientists say looks like Scotland's legendary Loch
Ness monster.

American geologists made the find in January, but did not announce the
discovery until this week at an international earth sciences meeting in
Wellington, New Zealand.

The find shows that at least four different types of mosasaur lived in
the Antarctic. One type had previously been found only in North America
and Europe.

Mosasaurs have been found across the world from Sweden to New Zealand,
but never in Antarctica.

The mosasaur discovery shows the Antarctic was once much warmer than it
is now. The scientists believe the creatures probably came to the
Antarctic around 75 million or 80 million years ago.

Mosasaurs were around 10 metres long. Their huge skulls were filled
with 10 centimetre long teeth.

A team at an American museum are studying the fossils.
Fish plant workers in Newfoundland are concerned about a work hazard called "shellfish asthma."

The illness, which appears unique to this kind of work, is an allergy
that gives a person flu-like symptoms. It can happen to workers who are
exposed to crab and shrimp meat.

The fishing industry is important to the Newfoundland economy, and way
of life. However, in recent years environmental concerns have forced the
government to place limits on how many fish can be caught.

Due to these limits, finding a fishing industry job in Newfoundland is
tough. Crab and shrimp have become important to the Newfoundland fishing
industry. Shellfish plants have created some important jobs that help
replace the ones that were lost. Many workers are trying to live with
their symptoms so they can keep their jobs at the fish plants.

But the union representing plant workers says shellfish asthma is a real
workplace disease. They feel there should be protection for employees
who have trouble working because of shellfish asthma.

There has been almost no research on shellfish asthma.

The union that represents the workers is trying to find out how many
employees suffer from shellfish asthma symptoms. They will then join
forces with the Canadian Auto Workers union to find out what can be done
for people who have to give up their job.
About 150 angry Calgary, Alberta parents braved cold, wet weather
yesterday to protest in hopes of avoiding a teachers' strike.

They demonstrated in front of the city's public school board building.
Well over 6,000 Calgary public school teachers are poised to strike
Monday, which would cancel classes for 100,000 students.

The Alberta Teachers Association says it's frustrating to see the
provincial government more preoccupied with tax cuts than education.

Local union president Kurt Moench says funding needs to be provided for
teacher salaries and student growth.

Class size is the biggest stumbling block in the dispute between the
board and the teachers' union.

The teachers say that there are too many students in each class and that
means students are not getting all of the help they need. The 6,600
teachers want the return of a ratio of one teacher for every 18.4
students.

Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said even he expects teachers to walk off
the job.

"I think there's going to be a strike -- I hope that there won't be," 
said Klein in Edmonton, the province's capitol city.

The province's education minister has urged both sides to keep talking.

While a strike will leave more than 95,000 students in academic limbo
and parents scrambling to make alternate arrangements, Grade 12 diploma
exams will go on.

School board chair Teresa Woo-Paw has said the board can't afford to
meet the teachers' demands.

The present school board plans would mean that 200 teachers would lose
their jobs.
Canada's 
minister of health has announced a new plan to try to discourage teenagers from 
smoking: The Yuck Factor. The government wants to put graphic pictures and warnings 
on all cigarette packages. 
Allan Rock said yesterday that he's convinced the labels will work. But many of 
the young smokers he's targeting aren't so sure. The warnings cover half of each 
side of a cigarette package. There are 16 messages and images, including pictures 
of diseased lungs.

Teenage smokers 
at a high school in Ottawa say some of the warnings are funny, but others, like 
an image showing a mouth full of rotting teeth, are disturbing and may make them 
think twice.

"I have to say this 
one with the teeth is quite disgusting. And I'm sure it will discourage a few 
smokers from starting up anyway," said one of the teens.

But a 17-year-old 
smoker said he knows all about the dangers of his habit and new warnings won't 
make him quit.

"If you smoke, you 
know what's going to happen to you. Just seeing it a warning label is going to 
gross you out every time you take a cigarette. It's not really going to stop you."

But Rock believes 
the warnings will make a difference. He says his department has done extensive 
surveys and he thinks the labels will be effective.

"Our testing, our 
focus groups and our surveys demonstrated that the old style warnings are losing 
their force. It's important for us now to take fresh steps and that's what we're 
doing today."

Anti-smoking organizations 
have applauded the strategy. The Non-Smokers Rights Association says the labels 
will give people a graphic reminder of the harmful effects of smoking a cigarette.

But the plan has 
a very powerful enemy. The tobacco industry is considering whether it should take 
the government to court.

The Canadian Tobacco 
Manufacturers Association, which represents tobacco companies, says it would take 
two years and cost millions of dollars to change the packaging on Canadian cigarettes. 
Spokesman Rob Parker is convinced the warnings won't work.

"They're still doing 
the same old thing, yelling even louder at smokers to quit or non-smokers not 
to start. It hasn't worked," says Mr. Parker.

The minister says 
he hopes to have the new cigarette packages on store shelves by the end of the 
year. He says tobacco companies that don't comply won't be selling their product 
in Canada.
Number Ninety-Nine retired from professional hockey yesterday afternoon,
but less than 24 hours later he's not shying away from sports.

Later today Wayne Gretzky will be competing again.

At four o'clock this afternoon, the player hockey fans say is probably
the best the game has ever known, and that some people say is the
greatest professional athlete ever will be... bowling.

The revelation came late in yesterday's news conference.

In front of hundreds of reporters from all over North America and Europe
Wayne Gretzky announced that he was going to hit the 10-pin bowling
lanes in New York City.

"I'm going to spend the afternoon with my teammates - a bowling party
and I'm looking forward to it, I'm going to enjoy. I've only bowled in
Canada and it's five pin, they tell me here its 10 pin. I don't know if
I can lift the ball. "

Yesterday was an emotional day for Gretzky fans.

With tears and typical grace, Wayne Gretzky skated away from
professional hockey. It's the second time in three months that one of
the world's premier athletes has chosen to retire.

"It was a tough game for me today," Mr. Gretzky said of his farewell
from the sport he dominated for two decades. "I wanted it to be a
celebration.

"You know, this is not a passing on," he added, his eyes watery. "This is
a moving on."

It was a moving scene as the sport's greatest player said goodbye. The
National Hockey League also retired No. 99, which commissioner Gary
Bettman announced would never be worn in the league again.

Gretzky has been the National Hockey League's Michael Jordan -- an
almost mythical figure that fans of all teams admired and packed arenas
to see.

Perhaps fittingly, Jordan himself appeared in a second-period video,
telling Gretzky, "Your golf game is not going to get better, so don't
think that will help. Relax and enjoy being a dad."

"It's always too soon when you see a great player retire," said Mario
Lemieux, the retired Pittsburgh Penguins centre. "It's going to be very
difficult for the National Hockey League to lose the best hockey player
that ever played, and he's been such a great ambassador for the game for
20 years."

In front of Lemieux sat Mark Messier - who played with Mr. Gretzky for
the Edmonton Oilers - and many other former teammates and opponents who
admired "The Great One".

When the game was over (the Penguins won 2-1) Gretzky smiled through
tears during four final laps of Madison Square Garden. He skated slowly
enough for plenty of souvenir photos to be taken of the player who holds
or shares 61 NHL records.

Whenever he noticed a youngster's extended hand from the crowd, he
touched it. He even played to the fans, donning a blue Yankees hat, then
a red Rangers beret.

Then, almost as suddenly as word had come last week that he was
retiring, Number 99 was gone.

"I'm devastated I will no longer be a hockey player," said Wayne
Gretzky, 38, his eyes still red, said more than an hour after his final
skate. "I will miss every part of the game, because I loved every part
of the game.

"But I've made the right decision."

As he left the arena, Wayne's father and mother told him they were proud
of him.
Residents of British Columbia's Lower Mainland seem to be freer with
their cash than they are with their time.

The Red Cross is thanking the public for donating more than $250,000 to
help refugees in the Balkans over the past two months. 
Spokesperson Adrienne Bakker says the Red Cross Appeal has received an
average of $20,000 a week.

But B.C.'s attorney general says few people have come forward to help
the Kosovo refugees who will soon arrive in British Columbia. Ujal
Dosnajh stresses there is no cost, and no requirement to put refugees in
homes.

Mr. Dosanjh says he is looking for more than 200 sponsors who can
provide emotional and psychological support. Church groups, schools, and
businesses can offer their assistance to the government.

"Kosovars" is the term generally used for people of Albanian ethnic
heritage who live in the southern Yugolsavian province of Kosovo.

In Calgary, Alberta, for example, the Unitarian Church is sponsoring a
group of refugees. This means everything from finding clothes and
shelter to finding schools for the children and jobs for their parents.

One member of the church, Thordis Gutnick, will be spending the next
couple of months teaching English to the refugees. She is looking
forward to it as she says it will allow her to show them what a
wonderful country Canada can be. She is also looking forward to
discussing the NATO bombing with them. Ms. Gutnick has been opposed to
the bombing since it began on March 24. She wants to hear the opinions
of the refugees and try and better understand what is happening in
Yugoslavia.

So far nearly 5,000 Kosovo refugees have come to Canada. But they won't
be the last displaced Kosovars headed here. More refugees will continue
to arrive under Canada's family reunification plan.

"Some 2,000 people have been identified as potentially eligible for that
program. Of those, 400 have already arrived," says Raphael Girard,
Canada's ambassador to Yugoslavia.

Canada has set no limit for the number of refugees eligible for the
family reunification plan.

When the airlift ends Wednesday, Canada will have fulfilled its pledge
to accept 5,000 refugees. Officials say Ottawa won't take in more unless
requested by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

Out of 135,000 spaces for refugees offered by the international
community, only 55,000 have been transported out of the region in the
last month.

The ambassador said that there is anxiety among the Kosovar leadership
that by taking refugees so far afield "many of these people will not
return and in so doing Yugoslavia President Slobodan Milosevic's agenda
(of getting rid of ethnic Albanians living in the southern Yugoslavian
province of Kosovo) will be achieved."

In total, 1.6 million people have fled Kosovo as Yugoslavian Serb forces
purge the province of ethnic Albanians. This weekend, 18,000 people
arrived in neighboring Albania and Macedonia.
American President Bill Clinton wants tougher gun control in the United
States

On Thursday, he had some help. About 95 students from across the United
States made their way to the White House to help President Clinton
convince the American government to put stricter controls on guns.
Included in the group were six students from Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colorado.

In April, Columbine High School was the scene of the worst high school
shooting in American history. Two teenage gunmen shot and killed 13
students. The gunmen then killed themselves.

Clinton wants to pass new gun control laws before school starts in
September. He wants to make it more difficult for people in the United
States to get guns. By limiting access to guns, President Clinton hopes
to put an end to school shootings like the one in Littleton.

But it appears unlikely the students' efforts will have an immediate
impact.

Some members of the government are against gun control. They think
violent video games and movies are more to blame for these incidents
than guns.

Some members of the public are opposed to gun control for another
reason. They believe people should decide for themselves if they want to
own a gun or not.

These people who are against gun control plan to delay the creation of
any new gun laws.
It was just past midnight in Newfoundland and Star Wars was up on the
screen.

Hundreds of fans camped out for hours to get choice seats for the
premiere of the much-anticipated film.


The St. John's fans were among the first in the world to see "Star Wars:
Episode 1 The Phantom Menace."

Midnight arrives in Newfoundland a half-hour before the rest of eastern
North America.

Advance tickets for the first two days of round-the-clock showings went
on sale last week and were quickly snapped up.


In cities across Canada fans began lining up for tickets in late April.
In Montreal someone actually slept in a tent out on the sidewalk in
front of a movie theatre to make sure he got the first ticket.

Mark Churchill and Ken Green were at the St. John's screening. Mark says
it's "definitely a five star movie." Ken says, "the story was awesome,
the effects were top notch, and even the acting was well done."

Some Star Wars fans from Iceland were so anxious to see the movie, they
flew to Halifax for the showing. Otherwise, they would to have had to
wait several months for its Icelandic release.

And as if shelling out up to $9 for a Star War's ticket isn't bad
enough: How about $50 or more?

It's what some scalpers are asking in Los Angeles, California.

"It's horrible," said Tom Sherak, who helps distribute the film. "This
is just what we didn't want."

When tickets went on sale each customer was limited to 12 tickets,
although there has been no formal way to stop scalpers from returning to
snag more tickets.

Offers for tickets have been common on the Internet.

There were examples of tickets getting bids for double or triple
their face value. One seller got a bid of $89.99 for two $8.50
tickets for Mann's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, or roughly five
times the face price.

As for the critics, well, as expected they are divided.

In the Toronto Star, Geoff Pevere says "If you don't forgive the
narrative gaps and inconsistencies... you forget them when the movie's
breathtaking digital set pieces kick in. And if you don't, you're in the
wrong movie."


In the National Post, Stephen Cole says, "...it's a piece that's
missing, specifically the presence of a larger-than-life villain, that
prevents Lucas's new film from truly succeeding as epic entertainment."
And Liz Braun in the Toronto Suns says, "fans... will not be
disappointed, and those non-fans who expect nothing from the film will
be pleasantly surprised."
Catastrophic flooding is possible in British Columbia's Fraser Valley
this year, because an estimated 150 kilometres of dikes along the banks
of the Fraser River are at risk, officials say.

If the river does overflow, thousands of people would have to leave
their homes and hundreds of square kilometres of farmland would be under
water.

Early settlers recognized the potential of the fertile soils along the
Fraser for growing food. Busy harbours and towns grew nearby because of
easy access to inland and marine transportation routes. This intensely
used river is home to five deep-sea port facilities, a ferry terminal,
several fishing boat basins and numerous marinas and floating homes.

Over 200 companies, including several large woodand fish processing
facilities operate on or near the Fraser. It also accommodates the
largest log booming grounds in the world.

The Fraser River is the largest river in British Columbia, over 1378
kilometres. long. Its headwaters are at Mount Robson in Jasper National
Park. The drainage of the entire river basin (watershed) is nearly one
quarter of a million square kilometers -- larger than the area of Great
Britain.

The flood of 1948, the last major flood in the Lower British Columbia
Mainland, flooded the area with almost 8 metres of water, just 80
kilometres from Vancouver. The 1948 flood claimed 10 lives, destroyed or
damaged 2,300 homes and caused $20 million in damage -- about $140
million in current dollars.

Total water flows in the Fraser River this spring are predicted to reach
94 per cent of 1948 flood levels.

Although some dikes have been improved, the potential for disaster
lingers if further prevention measures aren't taken, provincial
officials said yesterday.

The worst flood in the area's history was in 1894, when water levels
reached 7.92 metres. A federal-provincial Fraser River flood-control
program has rebuilt about 250 kilometres of dikes to withhold water
levels as high as those in the 1894 flood. But officials say an
estimated 150 kilometres of dikes in the Lower Mainland and Fraser
Valley could not hold back that much water.

Should high-water levels persist for abut two weeks, the dikes would be
at serious risk of becoming saturated and breaching (breaking), or
allowing seepage to escape through the soil and bubble up around homes
and buildings.

"This can be quite dangerous if not controlled," says Environment
Ministry spokesman Neil Peters. "There is always the possibility the
dike could fail."

Ultimately, the water levels depend on the weather. If the snow melts
gradually, there would probably be high, but safe, water levels. 
A very rapid melt could result in major flooding. "The worst-case
scenario is a month of scorching weather," Peters said. "We would
approach 1948 or 1894 levels."

River levels are unlikely to peak before mid-May at earliest, and the
peak flows might not occur until late June.

Even if 1894 river levels aren't reached this spring, it's just a matter
of time before they are, Peters says. "We know this flood will occur
sooner or later."
Pascal Hudon's nightmarish trip to Mexico is almost over. Today he is
in a Mexican hotel, waiting to find out when he will finally be allowed
to fly back to Montreal.

Pascal, who is 20, was released yesterday from the Chiapas state
penitentiary of Cerro Hueco -- where he had staged a hunger strike to
protest his arrest last September 28th. He was set free after relatives
paid a $1,200 fine.

Last fall Mexican prosecutors charged Pascal with stealing small clay
figurines from the Palenque ruins. He was put in jail in January.

A local judge found Hudon guilty of the theft charges. Under Mexican
law, all pre-Hispanic artifacts are considered national treasures.

"He's very happy because he's returning to his country," his lawyer,
Alphonso Herrera Gonzalez, said.

"He called me from a pay phone to say he was finally free," his mother,
Jocelyne Dion, told the french language newspaper Le Journal de Montreal. "He was shouting with joy."

For the Mexican authorities, their fight to prevent the looting of
Mexico's vast stash of historical treasures is far from resolved.

"Looting and the illegal export of archeological goods is fairly
prevalent," says Joaquin Garcia, chairman of Mexico's archeology
council.

Mexico has about 200,000 archeological sites, and only about 150 are
monitored constantly and open to the public, he said.

"It's quite difficult to take care of them. We depend much on the people
who live near the sites."

Although Mexico has had laws to prevent looting since the middle of the
19th century, Mexicans have become increasingly alarmed lately about
losing their national heritage to looters, and have started to apply
their laws with greater vigilance.

Mr. Hudon was a prime example of the new get-tough attitude.

The former college student was found carrying eight pieces of ceramics,
which he said he found on a path in the bush near the Palenque
historical site in southern Mexico.

Mr. Hudon has said he had intended to hand over the pottery to
authorities, but before he had a chance to do so, he was stopped by
police.

They searched him and charged him with illegally possessing artifacts.

He was put in a federal prison in Tuxtla Gutierrez in Chiapas state in
the south of Mexico at the beginning of January.

At a trial in February, he was sentenced to a year in jail plus one
month of labour, and told to pay $72,000 to the National Institute of
History and Anthropology.

His family and friends in Montreal protested, and Mr. Hudon went on a
hunger strike.

The Canadian embassy intervened, and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy spoke publicly about the need to get the young man out of
prison in Chiapas.

Last month, Mr. Hudon appealed the case. He was allowed to give a new
statement through a translator. The judge ruled that he was not legally
obliged to pay $72,000 to the institute, and lowered the fine to $2,500.

Artifacts, some dating back tens of thousands of years, are frequently
stolen when sites are discovered by excavators or through small-scale
looting, he said.

There has been looting at only three major projects in the past 15 years
-- projects run by foreign experts. All three were halted and many
artifacts recovered. Small-scale looting, however, has landed between 40
and 50 people in jail every year. And Mr. Garcia is sure much theft goes
undetected.

Despite his serious troubles, Pascal has not lost the urge to travel. He
told his mom that after he visits with his family back in Montreal, he
wants to head out to British Columbia to work as a tree-planter.

A team of Calgary researchers says that they have discovered one of the
causes of diabetes.

The scientists have spent the last eight years in the lab trying to
pinpoint the immune system's role in diabetes.

Dr. Ji-Won Yoon and his team at the University of Calgary say their
research gives insight into what triggers insulin-dependent diabetes.

But, diabetics will have to be patient -- a cure for humans is between
five and 10 years away.

However, that didn't temper the enthusiasm of diabetic Holly McWilliams.
"This is very exciting," said the 18-year-old Calgarian who has had to
inject insulin four times a day since she was three years old to stay
alive.

She now uses an insulin pump to maintain proper levels of the hormone.

Diabetics are at risk of blindness, circulatory problems, heart disease
and kidney failure, but with proper diet, exercise and insulin, it can
be controlled.

There are at least two strands of diabetes:

Type 1 -- when the body doesn't produce insulin.

Type 2 -- when insulin in the body doesn't work properly.

Dr. Ji-Won Yoon's discovery affects Type 1 diabetics, which inflicts
about 100,000 Canadians.

One and a half million Canadians have diabetes; more than 750,000 have
it and don't know it. 
"This is a major landmark study and it helps us understand the disease
in a way we haven't in the past," says Dr. David Lau of the Julia
McFarlane Diabetes Research Centre.

Dr. Yoon's research on mice focuses on how a diabetic's immune system
attacks cells that produce insulin, which is needed to help the body
properly use sugars.

A protein in the pancreas, which produces insulin, plays a critical role
in triggering diabetes in mice. Destruction of insulin-producing cells
by the immune system can be prevented by halting protein production.

Dr. Yoon said his work could lead to transplants of tissue that fight
the sugar build-up process or possibly a vaccine.

Lau is confident studies on mice will also work on humans.
It sounds like the story from the dinosaur movie Jurassic Park.

A wooly mammoth that was mummified 23,000 years ago, will be dug out of
the frozen ground by a group of international scientists.

The mammoth was found in Siberia, a large area in Russia with a cold
climate similar to Canada's far north. His head has decomposed, but his
body remains intact under the permanently frozen tundra.

Scientists hope to create an exact duplicate mammoth through cloning
techniques. To do this, they will use the DNA they hope to find in the
mammoth's soft tissues and hair.

The scientists say the colour of the mammoth's hair is still present, as
is the smell of the skin. This means the hair or skin may still contain
the DNA needed for the cloning experiment.

Mammoths are most similar to modern-day Asian elephants. An elephant is
expected to act as the host or mother of the mammoth when it is created.

The scientists say a cloned mammoth will help them study the habits of
an animal that lived many years ago.

The mystery of the mammoth's extinction is still unsolved. Scientists
hope this discovery could be a giant leap in answering this puzzling
question.
Students and parents struggled to come to grips with Tuesday's tragic
shooting at a Colorado high school that left more than a dozen people
dead. Police in Littleton searched for bombs set by the young killers.

Police now say 16 people died in the shooting rampage, including one
teacher and the two students who turned their guns on themselves.

The two boys who carried this out belonged to a group of teenagers who
called themselves the "Trenchcoat Mafia."

There are reports that a bomb exploded late Tuesday night as police
tried to remove it.

A spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department has said bomb
squads may need several days to complete searching the school for
explosives.

There is as of right now no apparent reason for the shootings other than
the boys have told schoolmates in the past that they felt they did not
fit in. Their gang reportedly disliked minorities and athletes.

Witnesses said the boys laughed as they methodically moved through the
school shooting people at random. Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone
described their actions as a "suicide mission."

Outside the school, police arrested three young men who've been
described as friends and possibly accomplices of the gunmen.

American President Bill Clinton went on television yesterday to express
his condolences to the families and friends of the victims. He said the
challenge facing America is to teach its young people to resolve their
problems with "words not weapons."

Clinton said he would have more to say on the issue of violence in the
school system later this week.

The rampage began just before noon as the two boys in black trench coats
and black masks walked into the school, armed with guns and explosives. 
One witness said they seemed to be shooting at random and shouting that
they were seeking "revenge."

For hours, students inside the building hid in fear for their lives.
Some students took cover the school's choir room and were able to stay
in touch with police by using their cell phones.

Students have said that the teacher who shepherded the students into the
choir room is a hero.

Hours later, the gunmen were found dead in the library.

Columbine high school is in the middle-class part of Littleton,
population 35,000. It opened in 1973 and has an enrollment of about
1,800.

Authorities said they were able to clear 90 per cent of the students out
of the building almost immediately. The rest were cleared out after the
shooting stopped.

Because of the shooting, Colorado lawmakers have put off adopting a law
that would help gun owners carry concealed weapons.

The bill's sponsor, Representative Doug, says the Columbine school
tragedy might have been offset if a faculty member or administrator had
been armed.

But Representative Russell George says he's getting e-mail from people
saying "see what happens when you have guns?"

Canadians are not allowed to carry concealed guns except in special
cases.
Glen Clark is facing great pressure to quit his job as the Premier of
British Columbia.

Political analysts say Clark, who is also the leader of the B.C. New
Democratic Party, has two options. Either he can ask the other elected
members in his party for forgiveness, or he can quit his job.

Glen Clark has been involved in a series of scandals during his time as
B.C. Premier. Money budgeting problems and a very expensive project to
build new ferries to Vancouver Island have helped make Clark unpopular.

On Monday, a cabinet minister in Clark's government left her job as the
minister for Women's Equality.

This is the second cabinet minister from Clark's government to quit in
the last week. The finance minister quit her job on Friday. Two other
party members resigned earlier this month.

According to a B.C. television station, Clark was sent a letter by a
group of people in his own party. The letter apparently asked the
Premier to quit his job. Some members of the B.C. government think if
Clark keeps his job as Premier, he will lead the New Democratic Party to
a big loss in the next election.

But not everyone in the government has problems with Clark. Some party
members think those who have problems with him should tell him in
private. They think there is still some hope that the Premier can win
an election and keep his job.
Maple Leaf Gardens. More than a hockey rink, it's a cultural
institution. It may well be the strongest link between Toronto and the
rest of Canada. And this weekend, the Gardens are losing the Maple
Leafs.

For thousands of people from coast to coast to coast, this
Saturday is a special hockey night in Canada. It will be the last time
the Leafs take to the ice at Maple Leaf Gardens.

With the end in sight, the hype -- and mourning -- is beginning in
earnest.

More than one building in one city, the Gardens has long been a focal
point for Canadian culture -- at least for anyone who has ever strapped
on the blades.

For decades, NHL games were broadcast into living rooms From Plum
Coulee, Manitoba to Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, and beyond from one of
two places -- the Gardens or the Montreal Forum.

With the end in sight, fond memories are starting to flow.

In recent weeks, for example, hockey fans from Western Canada have been
making the trek to Toronto to see one last game at the Gardens.

Two weeks ago Brent Shuya and his son made the 3-and-a-half hour drive
from their home in Russell, Manitoba to Winnipeg.

There they hopped on an airplane for another two hour ride to 
Toronto.  The reason: to see their one and only hockey game
at Maple Leaf Gardens.

Brent says, "it was pretty important to me, I wanted my son to go and
visit the 
Gardens, seeing how they are not going to be playing there anymore.
I've always been a Leaf fan probably since I was five or six years old
and I guess I always will be whether they win or lose, and it was
just nice to see them play in their old home."

But Brent Shuya is by no means the only western hockey fan who has made
one final pilgrimage to Maple Leaf Gardens. On his trip he met other
fans 
from the Prairies doing the same thing. There is no one explanation
as to why some fans outside Toronto feel such a strong attachment to
the Leafs and the building in which they play, although radio and
television have had much to do with it.

Fans like Winnipeg businessman Jeff Thompson will be at the final game
on Saturday.

"The Gardens and the Montreal Forum were both places that although 
we were never there, as kids growing up we were there," he says. "They
came
into our house every weekend. It became larger than life because
we had grown up watching it".

Winnipeger Bill Juzda was known as one of the toughest players in the
NHL
when he played for the Leafs in the 1950s. Mr. Juzda expects many of
those
at the final game Saturday will feel pretty much the way he
did when he first walked into Maple Leaf Gardens nearly 50 years ago.

He says, "you walked in and you seen all those pictures in the lobby
and everything else. And you stood outside and said, hey,
I used to listen to Foster Hewitt on the radio and boy am I
lucky to be here."

Foster Hewitt was the Maple Leafs' radio broadcaster for decades. His
voice was known by Canadians from coast to coast. He first broadcast a
hockey game on the radio in March, 1923. Decades later he became the
Leafs' first television announcer. 

In Toronto, many residents are sad to see the Leafs abandon the Gardens
for the new Air Canada Centre.

One fan is Tommy Gaston. For almost 60 years, the 82-year-old and his
wife Ruth were in their seats for Leafs home games -- Grey Section West,
Seats 13 and 14.

After Saturday, the Gastons will have just their fond memories of the
Gardens, built in 1931.

But Gaston won't have trouble preserving his memories. A self-described
pat rack, he has collected enough memorabilia to stock his basement --
and donate the overflow to the Hockey Hall of Fame.
The big cable news network CNN has opened up a new bureau. 

It's not in China or Chile -- it's at a high school in Winnipeg! The
students in Ken Corley's World Studies class at Sisler High Schoo
